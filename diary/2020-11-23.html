<p>Early dream in the night featured Julian and Miriam at a very young age. My affection for both of them was pervasive.</p>
<p>Last dream dream before waking featured prominently +Bob. He was Machiavellian and not to be trusted.</p>
<p>I think that seeing the other day that the church in Hilton Head and another in LA, Fernando Beach was it?, use liturgies from the Church of England. Maybe it’s Covid. Maybe it’s the age we live in. Maybe it’s the seminary preparation that happens now. Maybe it’s the way in which the Episcopal Church has moved to be just another Protestant denomination. But it’s become a church that I don’t recognize and don’t really want to be a part of.</p>
<p>My time is long past.</p>

<p>Janey emailed a link to a Jewish scripture person who made a big impact on her.</p>
<p>Sally/Janey view the slippery liturgical oversight I saw in Hilton Head and LA as a result of the guidance or lack thereof of the bishop. Apparently “Charleston” is still functioning with a temporary bishop.</p>
