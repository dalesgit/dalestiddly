<p>So much we don't know about bringing Gini home. It's going to be very different from what was going on a week ago. Katy doesn't know. What is the plan if Katy can't do it? Are the 24/7 nurses starting Monday?</p>
<p>MP noted that if they sent mom to a skilled nursing through Kettering and through this admission, I think Medicare is paying. If they go home, they won't have that option. <span id="Stupid."></span><strong>Stupid.</strong></p>
