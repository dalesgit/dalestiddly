<h1 id="disaster">Disaster</h1>
<p>Last night was very problematic. It left me feeling quite alone. My dreams seemed to build on that. It was just me. Somewhere. Somehow. But I can’t remember details.</p>
<p>I was cleaning up kitchen. MP cooked so she sat in the living room while someone else cleaned up. If Sean had been here he would have been her boy. Last night he was at work so I was the boy. I went to put the paella away and I found a conglomeration of plastic containers and I saw no way to fit the lid to the container. Moreover, the pile that I had put on the counter earlier in the day was just thrown back in. I said, “I’m sure you would agree that it’s not helpful to have the containers piled in without a connection to the lids.” She responded by defending herself, “I know. Sometimes I’m just too tired to go to the effort.” Then when she came back out to see the pile on the counter, without saying anything, she threw them all into trash bags and put them in the garage. After that, scarcely a word passed between us. After she got back from picking up Sean she spent the evening in the living room. I was in the bedroom.</p>
<p>Again, it felt like something snapped last night for me. Along the lines, “If that’s the way it is, I just don’t need it.”</p>

<p>I had received word back from Scott from my birthday greetings. He said, “I don’t have many friends. But you are the oldest and the dearest.” He also indicated that he has had some health issues.</p>
<h1 id="zettelkasten-zettl">Zettelkasten / Zettl</h1>
<p>I worked a little with these, trying to get a sense of just the mechanics of how they work. But I gathered in the last few days that one of the important characteristics is mutual connections between notes. As I saw that the <strong>sidebar</strong> changed based on various criteria and that it indicated relationships that weren’t intentional or obvious. A light went on.</p>
