<h1 id="its-just-a-few-things-but-they-were-defining.-significance">It’s just a few things, but they were defining. Significance?</h1>
<ul>
<li>prayed together every day. Model of Benedictine community. When she asked me when I was going to forgive Sean I told her that I couldn’t pray under those conditions. She never understood. Always thought it was my whimsy and narrow heart that caused the cessation.</li>
<li>I did the dishes. I shared with others, so it was a way of being public with our love, that I did the dishes if she cooked and I did the dishes if I cooked. Sean arrived and doing the dishes was what she told him to do. Dishes became a chore, and one that he didn’t know how to do. Not by my model of Bro. Jimmy (and my mother) that doing the dishes was making it cleaner than I found it. Not like Bro. Lawrence for whom doing dishes was the place to meet God.</li>
<li>Little affections became perfunctory and then unnecessary.</li>
<li>little by little my perspective slipped into just my narrow-minded limited prejudice, one that needed correcting</li>
<li>things like with Karen the counselor, we pursue the notion that Sean has made all the difference until that becomes uncomfortable for MP and then she’s adamant that it was all from before Sean. It was terrible and going down-hill for a long time. My observation that 1 year ago our life together looked very different from her description.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="i-am-so-perplexed-as-to-how-to-respond-or-go-forward.">I am so perplexed as to how to respond or go forward.</h1>
<p>Since yesterday there had felt like kind of a truce. At one point yesterday she came over and kissed me just before she set off to take Sean to a meeting. I tried to grapple with how I should respond to things. I thought that staying quiet and reserved left her free to interpret it as rejection and “refusing to talk.” At the same time I felt like anything I said ended up being counter-productive or used against me.</p>
<p>There were episodes like:</p>
<ul>
<li>beginning a sentence, she interrupts before I finish, and then ignores what I was trying to say or dismisses it and reiterates her point (cf. observation about Michael Caine in a movie with Shirley MacLaine.)</li>
<li>today seemed to be in a truce. She took a long, 2 hour plus nap, while I went for a walk and a trip to Longs. When I got back she had a phone call from Annie, with pictures of the placemats. I commented kind of neutrally. Some minutes passed while I was fiddling with what I had brought back from CVS. She asked me if I would refill the refrigerator water. I said I would be happy to. I did. Shortly after that she came out and filled a glass of water. I made some kind of utterly inocuous comment/question about the show she had been watching.</li>
<li>My words clearly set off something within her. She said something back to me, very snappy, that included somehow the word “fuck”. I was flabbergasted. Finally I said to her, “What did I do to deserve that kind of response?”</li>
<li>She responded, “What did I deserve for you to say that I was as bad as Bridget? That I was the worst thing you’ve been around in 40 years.”</li>
<li>I, of course, said no such thing. But I was irritated with the counselor that she didn’t back me up when I said that I didn’t say anything about her (Mary Pat). I spoke in terms of how I had felt these past 4 months, comparing them to the last 30 years. At MP’s questioning then, I said that when Bridget was treating me so horribly I still had 2 daughters.</li>
<li>That seemed to be the time when the counselor, Karen, concluded that we had lots of back issues to deal with.</li>
<li>I finally said to Mary Pat, “Let me know when you’re ready to ask a different question. Namely, ‘What can we do to make things better?’”</li>
<li><p>She blurted quickly back, “Rather, what can you do to make things better?” # Yes, dear So I am unclear how to respond to your seeming demand. “What are you going to do to make things better?” (which is to say, How can I fix things?)</p></li>
<li>I recognize what you might mean by the statement that I am the only one that I am in charge of. That, in effect, supports what I have been saying for months now. How am I going to change so that the outcome is different?</li>
<li>What I said to you was, “These past months have been the most painful and distressing of my life in the past 30 years.” That’s in part because the collapse – downwards to the “You fucking liar!” – has been so far.</li>
<li>A year ago we were about to buy a house in Florida. There was a lot of good going on.</li>
<li>As you brought up at the counseling session, it was after that I made the statement, “I’m not coming back here.” But that was not said in a vacuum. It was said because I was appalled at the way your family treated you. And then I was hurt when, in effect, you said to me that I had no right no say anything in defense of you. You said then, and you have said it other times, that you can take care of yourself so I am not to say anything.</li>
<li>Should I say, “These past months I have been a horrid, terrible, no-good person. It is all a product of my venomous heart.”</li>
<li>Should I just say, “Forgive me for being such a horrible person these past few months?”</li>
<li>What about your claim that it’s not the past few months but it was already happening last year. Or for several years? What is it that I have not done to satisfy you?</li>
<li>What can I say or do to please you? If there is nothing, then what am I to do?</li>
<li>You have refused to acknowledge my expectation that you not ask</li>
<li><p>This notion that you seem to think that fixing this is somehow within my power reminds me of Emma’s line to me, “Fix this, Daddy.” We have seen that it didn’t satisfy Emma. I have long thought that I no doubt misunderstood what Emma was really saying to me. That makes me think that I am just not understanding what you are telling me.</p></li>
