<p>Sense of accomplishment with mending the comforter and the pillowcase. Neither of them was pretty. The machine didn't do well. But. I rode my bike.</p>
<p>Surprised? The brief exposure to Ken Burn's &quot;Country music&quot;.</p>
<p>Didn't like the many little things that were not going as planned on the way to and back from St.Â Paul's. The people thee were warm and splendid. Thank you.</p>
