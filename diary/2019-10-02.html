<h1 id="Examen">Examen</h1>
<p>Art museum in Birmingham. Started with a display on <span id="portraits"></span><strong>portraits</strong>. It was fascinating to see all the different ways that capturing the personality had been imagined over the centuries.</p>
<p>I'd had a conversation with Ed about the difference between the origins, the roots, of western civilization vs.Â say the Confucianism &amp; Taoism of China.</p>
<p>I keep being surprised by the cynicism of Ed's off the cuff observations. Obama was not a good leader. Western art couldn't portray joy. &quot;This is us&quot; was []{#so predictable}<strong>so predictable</strong>.</p>
<p>But he's a good guy. He's dominated by his wife. He was a Buddhist. He tinkers. And is a great handyman.</p>
<p>Joan seems more shallow to me than she used to. Her PhD seemed more impressive then, I guess. But I like them.</p>
<p>I feel sad leaving them. Like there's something wrong with us for not staying in Birmingham and being their friends. There's nothing that could persuade me to live in this city: the oppressive heat, the oppressive heritage of its past, the oppressive promise of it's future -- the woman governor who signed the abortion bill, the pedophile who will be running for senate again.</p>
<p>Where's my joy? It's here in this meager effort at writing, I think.</p>
