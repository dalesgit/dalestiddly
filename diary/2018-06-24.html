<p>I have a long day ahead of me and still I couldn't sleep. Some was ruminating about +Bob. Some not.</p>
<p>Then it hit me that what I was lacking was a *<span id="purpose"></span><strong>purpose</strong>*. Just as Mom had found her purpose in the pigeons, so I have found it along the way: parish ministry, teaching, preparing the house for moving, etc. The purpose of caring for Mary Pat is laudable but it has seemed somehow enervating.</p>
<p>I am really thinking of the character Rudolph Abel in the movie we saw the other night, []{#Bridge of Spies}<strong>Bridge of Spies</strong>. When repeatedly asked if he was worried, he responded, &quot;Would it help?&quot; in the calmest most Buddhist way.</p>
