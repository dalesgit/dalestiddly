<ul>
<li>followup call with David. He has weekly Zoom calls with Charlotte and family. He seemed to genuinely like the call -- and Mary Pat certainly relished it.</li>
<li>Almost finished producing the Final online version</li>
<li>made a long list of songs</li>
<li>lots of nostalgia as I listed all the songs in <em>Maranatha; Praise</em> I hadn't looked at that music, really, since leaving St. Mary's.</li>
<li>Some of MP's family has looked at my presiding at Sunday's Mass: Annie, Katy, … ?</li>
<li>Continued binge-watching <em>Scandal</em>. It turns out it's all about <span id="power"></span><strong>power</strong> and how it corrupts but is utterly alluring. I felt tonight echoes of <span id="Gollum"></span><strong>Gollum</strong> and the <span id="Ring"></span><strong>Ring</strong>.</li>
<li>I liked the penultimate episode we watched tonight because there was some aspect of human resolution and integration.</li>
<li>Sean called back because he thought that the first call with his mom -- asking about money -- had not led to good communication. He is really working. He may end up being better at it than his mother.</li>
<li>I think of Emma and Lydia all the time. <span id="Resolution"></span><strong>Resolution</strong>? []{#Move on}<strong>Move on</strong>? I wish I knew.</li>
<li>I have solved a lot of the dilemmas with the Android apps for Markdown. But it seems like maybe IAwriter is the best app after all. The only thing is that it doesn't project well for delivering my sermons.</li>

<h1 id="waking-up-waking-up">Waking up {#Waking up}</h1>
<ul>
<li>disappointment at finding I had bought ground coffee.</li>

<h1 id="Mid-day">Mid-day</h1>
<ul>
<li>Finished and readied exam</li>
<li>graded papers</li>
<li>watched 2 (so far) episodes of <em>Scandal</em>. It is now a tale of how power corrupts everyone it comes in contact with.</li>
