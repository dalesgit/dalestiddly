<p>You need to be generous to yourself in order to receive the love that surrounds you.</p>
<p>You can suffer from a desperate hunger to be loved. You can search long years in lonely places, far outside yourself. Yet the whole time, this love is but a few inches away from you. It is at the edge of your soul, but you have been blind to its presence.</p>
