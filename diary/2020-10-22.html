<p>Thu Oct 22, 2020 05:27 AM</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a whole new level of understanding the gulf between us. I really didn’t appreciate it adequately. Mary Pat was retaliating, I think, against the time a day or two previous when she was casually referring to some way in which our calendar that day was determined by Sean’s schedule, and I cut off conversation by saying, “That’s a Sean conversation that we can’t pursue right now.”</p>
<p>So we were in the bathroom. I was grooming somehow. She was getting out of the WC. She made some kind of comment about not liking her hair. I made what was intended as a light-hearted comment, thinking of the many women, mostly women of color, who have shaved their heads – often but not always in support of breast cancer solidarity – I said, “you could shave your head.”</p>
<p>She responded by gathering a very stern face and walking away, saying something to the effect, “The word ‘shave’ was the occasion for an major argument we had; so we can’t have that conversation.”</p>
<p>What she was recalling was a time that also caught me by surprise. Again she was talking about her hair and she made a reference to “shaving her head”, meaning the way in which her old hair person would cut one side of her head short, several times very short. She had probably used an electric shaver to cut part of her head, rather than scissors. MP and I were hearing the word “shave” to mean two different things. She understood, I think, using the tool to cut it very short. I understood “shave” to mean what Sean and Owen do to their head.</p>
<p>MP got extremely angry with me when I said, “She didn’t actually ‘<strong>shave</strong>’ your head.” MP said very angrily, “I was there. I know what she was doing to me.” At the time, either explicitly or via my intuition, I thought that she was projecting Doug, estranged and bullying husband, onto me. It wasn’t the first time I felt that, and not just when she confused our names, “Dale” “Doug”. “Shave” became a “trigger”, a “catalyst”, a “precipitate”.</p>
<p>As I learned yesterday, “shave” was yet one more subject we couldn’t talk about. One thing I have come to appreciate more fully since my last visit in Charlotte, is that the alienation between MP and me is greater than I understood. The things we “can’t talk about” have grown and grown.</p>

<p>The whole western side of Grand Lake and Lake Grandby have been evacuated. The smoke is like holocaust.</p>
<ul>
<li>learned to waterski, jumping off the dock, dropped ski,</li>
<li>caught brook trout</li>
<li>cooked and eaten over campfire, mist still rising over the water</li>
<li>jumped in water to fetch an overboard oar. I could so easily have died at that moment. Roy Jansen immediately cut the motor.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Standing out first reading: question is singular, Jesus’ answer is plural</li>
<li>O-M: word “question”</li>
<li>another (Josie): “teacher”</li>
<li>For me: our expectations are not the way God answers. Like a <strong>koan</strong>.</li>
<li>Courtney: What if you don’t love yourself?</li>
<li>MP: maybe what Jesus is saying is that they are both the same thing. Do one is doing the other.</li>
<li>Courtney focused on the questioning part. Should we question God? That raises for me the Jewish tendency to question and argue as a normal way of relating.</li>
<li>The reading has to do with different ways of interpreting Scripture. Jesus shows up in e.g. the method of reading scripture we are doing here. Overcoming the “authority” of the professionals.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am grateful that Biden seemed to hold his own. He didn’t seem to do something that would undermine his position. I’m not a rabid Democrat. In fact I have so much given up on political solutions that my fear is that I am just cynical. In fact, it may be that my decision-making will be more difficult if Trump loses – depending on how the rest of the voting goes. But the fact is that the elevation Amy Barret with the SC and the prospects of walking back the rights of women, LGBTQ, enforcing the authoritarian power of the Executive, loss of health insurance as a human right, these are huge issues.</p>
<p>I have known for some time that I am going to have to confront my own energy that looks to leaving the country.</p>
<p>It would be easier if I were estranged from MP, but I don’t want that.</p>
<p>But I do want to leave the country, living the rest of my days somewhere else. Ah, my dear.</p>
