<p>Evening spent at Judge's. Got to know Jane a little bit by asking her to talk about herself. She led a discussion that brought in Patrick with the general theme of getting high. Edibles and such like.</p>
<p>I ended up remembering 2 events in my own life reflecting similar dynamics to what they were talking about. The first was almost the last time I got high, when Owen was still very young. I was so upset that I felt like I couldn't take care of him. It was my little taste of paranoia. I also shared the time at the house in Colorado Spring where we sat around the telephone spool in the living room, smoking hash. And the knock on the door, right behind my back, was the police. My life passed before me and I thought it was over. But all he wanted was to tell us that there was a report of a []{#loud party}<strong>loud party</strong>.</p>
<p>Jane &amp; Patrick ended up outside the party as Jane had accidentally punched Patrick while they were dancing to the new year.</p>
