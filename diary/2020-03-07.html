<h1 id="exploitation-of-women-exploitation-of-women">Exploitation of women {#Exploitation of women}</h1>
<p>I watch <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> and it affects me for a day to come. The oppression gets in my bones.</p>
<p>I wonder why Mary Pat doesn't see that the opponents of abortion are the same crowd depicted in the &quot;Tale&quot;. They are exploiting, enslaving, and de-humanizing women. Whether it's Catholic prelates and the slavish followers, or Evangelical true-believers who will de-humanize anyone standing in their way.</p>
