<p>I've ordered the C434. Many people have called it the best buy of 2019. I've worked out with this Acer that my needs can probably be met with the Linux VM &amp; pcloud.</p>
<p>We spent 2 hours <a href="talking.html">talking</a> with Ed &amp; Becky yesterday. I said to MP that she should maybe consider going and visiting Becky once a week. Her response was that they like having both of us on a visit. I think it might be that mechanism that has so isolated MP and caused her depression -- but I cannot become her lap dog. It feels so controlling.</p>
<p>Surgery is in 2 days. Why am I so apprehensive. Why am I so negative about the US medical system -- I don't trust and I don't like doctors generally. They strike me as money-grubbing scoundrels without a like of care or concern for people, looking out for their own best interests. My model of vocation was so different from that.</p>

<p>This week's lessons prompted me to think about &quot;God of the Gaps&quot;. About finding grace in the empty places. And I had thought at some point that there is a connection with Whitehead's notion (from somewhere) about feeling disease vs.Â health. I think it's really about []{#paying attention.}<strong>paying attention.</strong></p>
<p>He noted that with our bodies we are aware of something when it isn't working properly. Otherwise we're not aware.</p>
<p>We need to listen. To pay attention so that we can become aware of the health, of the graces that abound, rather than only aware of the problems.</p>

<p>What are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease? If you have any of the types of fatty liver disease, there are some lifestyle changes that can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat a healthy diet, limiting salt and sugar, plus eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</li>
<li>Get vaccinations for hepatitis A and B, the flu and pneumococcal disease. If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver, it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections, so the other two vaccinations are also important.</li>
<li>Get regular exercise, which can help you lose weight and reduce fat in the liver</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk with your doctor before using dietary supplements, such as vitamins, or any complementary or alternative medicines or medical practices. Some herbal remedies can damage your liver. [medlineplus](https://medlineplus.gov/fattyliverdisease.html)</p>
<p>But importantly for the &quot;alcoholic fatty liver disease&quot; is to <span id="stop"></span><strong>stop</strong> drinking alcohol.</p>
