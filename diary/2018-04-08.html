<p>It has been a year since I even set foot in Our Savior. What should be such a welcoming, home-base, for us is a place filled with strangers. Weird.</p>
<p>Miriam responded to my request that she forward a message to Emma. I wrote a brief note card about Emma Gonzalez reminding me of Emma. In the context of Caroline's entrance into our family, the blanks and silences are at least ironic.</p>
<p>Watched a very impressive movie last night, []{#The Florida Projects}<strong>The Florida Projects</strong>. Real life. It caused me to say at one point that, &quot;Murray and Young Mi live just a notch above the folks at the short-term rental motel in Orlando. The homeless people they minister to are a notch below. But it all seem so very real. Amazing performances by the 7 y/o, the mother, &amp; Willem DeFoe.</p>
