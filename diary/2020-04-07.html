<ul>
<li>two presentations readied for 101</li>
<li>sent email to 101 re. password and waiting room for meeting</li>
<li>got a big chunk of my Easter sermon down in a draft during my walk. I went without a blog playing, with the intention of just letting my mind speak. It felt good.</li>
<li>the news got worse about the pandemic. John Prine died. It makes me sad. All the faces of death that are shown on the news.</li>
<li>I did a lot of work on the other 3 presentations for <em>Tent of Abraham</em>, but I didn't get started on grading the discussion threads</li>
