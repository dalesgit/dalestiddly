<h1 id="Today">Today</h1>
<p>I really need to make tangible progress on the class and much of the day will be spent traveling to Union Co.Â for MP.</p>
<p>I can feel it in my eyes when I have worked them hard -- like yesterday.</p>
<h1 id="after-lots-of-frustration-after-lots-of-frustration">After lots of frustration {#After lots of frustration}</h1>
<ul>
<li>pcloud was giving weird errors, two duplicates that froze my file manager and seemed rigged into pcloud</li>
<li>git corrupted the reveal.js folder</li>
<li>it could be that it got corrupted by git interacting with pcloud</li>
<li>I succeeded in getting a working presentation online</li>
<li>I decided I'm not going to keep a class web page, it will just my personal use to get at the presentations etc. -- maybe resources</li>
</ul>
<p>I also had trouble with getting emacs to work the way I wanted it to. I had to retract REVEAL_ROOT to &quot;../../&quot;</p>
<h1 id="work-on-next-work-on-next">Work on next {#Work on next}</h1>
