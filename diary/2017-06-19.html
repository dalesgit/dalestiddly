<p>==First full day in Tahoe== We learned last night that the family that we know of (Julian, Miriam) and maybe? (Katrina, Shirley, Vails, Bridget, Lydia, Owen) were at Emma's graduation. Bill had said that he had been invited but since our trip was scheduled they would see us.</p>
<p>Julian is driving 10-12 hours today to get back here to see us.</p>
<p>Mary Pat is very angry at my family. I told her that I had reflected that it was afflicted with secrets that it was keeping. In reflection I went on to say that I thought the <span id="shunning"></span><strong>shunning</strong> began with Bridget. &quot;Now there are 3 that hate me for who I am: Shirley, Bridget, &amp; Emma.</p>
<p>==email to Miriam== We are still anticipating arrival in Olympia on Sunday. Can you make any recommendations for where we ought to stay while there? In as much as no one was able to talk to me forthrightly about Emma's graduation, are there any other visits or commitments that you have that we ought to be aware of. We planned our whole summer around visiting my family, but it turns out that some of my children think that I am such a horrible person and father that I can't be talked to honestly. I gather that you are expecting or have had a visit with Katrina. I don't want to interfere with those plans. I'm not trying to be ugly, but I really don't have time left in my life for family secrets. I love you and your family and have appreciated that you have stayed connected with me.</p>
