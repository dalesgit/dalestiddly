<p>We read much of the 1st novel about Ireland. Both of us are enthralled. I said that 2 things enchanted me. First, going back to Doris Lessing &amp; Ann Tyler I have liked books that explore the world from a woman's perspective. The 2nd is that I appreciate the artistic success of a piece of writing that has similarities with the way that <em>This is Us</em> is done.</p>
