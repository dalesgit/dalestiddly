<p>We were putting on some kind of program. I was sort of an MC or something. I was in charge of some gadgets that were projector sort of thingies. I was having trouble keeping track of them. The program was supposed to involve the children; Lydia and Emma were involved somehow, I think.</p>
<h1 id="Confrontation">Confrontation</h1>
<p>Mary Pat was wrapping up odds and ends with the papers strewn around the guest room. There was a reference to the 2 plastic boxes of files in the office and she asked, &quot;Is there anything in there that ought to go in the filing cabinet?&quot; I didn't know how to answer, thinking about the hours that I had spent discarding things and consolidating down to those two boxes. My hesitation alone -- perhaps there was a look on my face also -- set her to throwing up her hands and walking away.</p>
<p>We had a talk where she projected an assumption that my files were something I was keeping from her and I told her that she could look at any of the files and make a decision about whether they needed to go in the filing cabinet. We both expressed frustration and not being appreciated. I began to tell her about my perception was that there was her way alone.</p>
