<h1 id="yesterdays-anniversary">Yesterday’s anniversary</h1>
<p>It went well, me thinks. The right kind of balance of not too much, but enough. MP gave me a thoughtful frame with pictures of us. Wonderful to have in view, featuring many of my favorites from the electronic frame. I gave her a poem. I don’t think it was great, and she was a little bit low-key about it. But I had tried to strike a balance – again that balance thing. Acknowledging the struggles we’ve had but affirming our mutual commitment to the marriage relationship.</p>
<p>I got my walk, but the lectures were about magicians and diviners. Not the kind of edifying experience that gives me energy. But it was of interest to me that he emphasized over and over that the point of prophets, seers, magicians, augurers, etc. in the ancient world was not about the future but about what to do in the present.</p>
<p>The same challenge we have in trying to teach the biblical prophets.</p>
<p>St. Paul’s is still in crisis. Jim is probably dying from lung cancer. I said yes to supplying beginning in January.</p>
<h1 id="emmas-response">Emma’s response</h1>
<p>She acknowledged receipt. Said that she “couldn’t read it now.” And she “requested” that I honor her desire for no contact.</p>
<p>It makes me think that Bridget told her that she assumes I molested her. What a crock and what a lie. To base a life on such a thing!</p>
<p>I imagined responding along the lines of, “You can do whatever you want.” Or, “You can live your life on a figment of imagination.” But, “You abdicated the right to request anything of me.”</p>
<p>I decided it’s best not to respond. But what a hopeless fuck that is.</p>
