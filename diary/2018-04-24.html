<p>She wanted someone to supply Jun 27 &amp; following Sunday. We can't but I did commit to later in July.</p>
<p>I asked her about the wedding stuff. A couple things she said that I need to keep track of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure Our Savior is on board</li>
<li>Involve a rector in the process as soon as he's on board</li>
<li>Also coordinate with Altar Guild or some other who might be wedding consultant, coordinator at the parish</li>
</ul>
<p>Her pre-marital is:</p>
<ul>
<li>get to know session, general, and then take &quot;Relationship Inventory&quot;</li>
<li>session 2 - conversation around the results</li>
<li>session 3 - sacraments etc. church stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>She didn't really respond to my request for someone else to do the preparation.</p>

<p>He is feeling a little bit better. But Fr. Nick &amp; Jim have both reported that Mom is non-responsive. So Bill has signed papers for getting her into Mesilla Valley. As of 7pm she is there. Still with her MSRP but it is localized in her bladder.</p>
<p>Nick is leaving to TX to take care of an ailing parent. An interim who is a woman will start at the end of April.</p>
<p>We don't know how long she will be lasting. We are agreed that it is not vital to have the service right after death. But Bill wouldn't want it in, e.g. July.</p>
<p>David is still thinking that Mom could get better or at least be as good as she was when he was with her.</p>
