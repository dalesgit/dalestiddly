<p>I have just finished her memoir of the 90’s, <em>When the heart waits</em>. I ended it, leafing through the notes, thinking, “This is an account of me. If I had been a writer, this is what I would have written. Certainly these are the authors I was reading and the writers who impacted me the most.”</p>
<p>Yesterday I finished her latest novel, <em>The Book of Longings</em>, imagining the wife of Jesus, representing the divine feminine. Again, I recognized the importance of the <em>Nag Hammadi</em> texts in her writing the novel, the feminine voice, “Little Thunder” the epithet Jesus used of her, and the text from the collection of “The Thunder Perfect Mind”:</p>
<p>I am the first and the last<br />
I am she who is honored and she who is mocked<br />
I am the whore and the holy woman…</p>
<p>Now I am looking at beginning the earlier memoir, about discovering God’s <strong>love</strong>, <em>God’s joyful surprise</em>. Looking at the notes, here too I will find much that is familiar by way of nostalgia. “If I had been a writer …”. But there is no point in turning away from the <strong>sacred now</strong>.</p>
