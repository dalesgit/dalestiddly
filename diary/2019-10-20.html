<p>Today we spend with Robbie and Jim. Yesterday with Bill &amp; Gary was fun for me. I could enjoy Gary's rapid fire mania. Bill was sick but apparently has some of that as well, according to MP. As she put it, now there is a large difference running between them, but apparently the love and care is still there. Bill long retired now, Gary looking forward to 10-15 years of career. Gary taking care of an ailing old man while he is an energetic man who swims every day, he says.</p>
