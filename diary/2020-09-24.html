<h1 id="like-a-cancer">Like a cancer</h1>
<p>It seems horrendous to even say it. Like the unbelievable Greek cursing in Kingsolver’s <em>Unsheltered</em>. Living with Sean is like living with Cancer. Yes, I know I should get past being depressed and sad over it. But it’s a big deal.</p>
<p>It started with my observing that I have a visceral dislike of him the likes of which I haven’t seemed to feel toward any other human being. Why? Where did that come from? Why is he so different?</p>
<h1 id="sense-of-accomplishment">Sense of accomplishment</h1>
<p>I have graded all the discussion threads, couple of hours, couple of sittings. Made possible by the organization of the whole thing into groups and then developing rubrics and then figuring out how Blackboard works to grade it.</p>
<p>Within the last couple of days I read about the spiritual health of reading thoughtful posts like Brainpickings. I have several years of that in my email. Every time I have picked it up I have come away inspired and lifted up. I have several years’ worth of thought to catch up on.</p>
<p>Again, to repeat myself, 2 things that give me joy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing – anything, really</li>
<li>playing piano – feeling some kind of rhythm – that’s not easy, and also feeling my hands and fingers “knowing” where to go, moving with just a little bit of confidence. I am aware that the training of my younger years lasted for a long time, but at age 70 it is mostly all gone. I have to be content with very modest sensations.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-used-to-be-between-mp-and-me">What used to be between MP and me</h1>
<ul>
<li>washing dishes</li>
<li>doing her toenails</li>
<li>new washing machine</li>
<li>new vacuum cleaner</li>
<li>going to grocery</li>
<li>taking out trash</li>
<li>preparing meals</li>
<li>praying together</li>
<li>at first we drove him to work together</li>
<li>we used to go to symphony</li>
<li>we used to go to church together</li>
<li>we used to travel together. Now I think travel is the 3 of us.</li>
<li>In her mind we watched tv together. I bristled at it being every night, but there it was. Now it is 3 of us watching tv. Or else when I didn’t want to no one did.</li>
<li>making the bed (I don’t care now)</li>
<li>she turned off kissing on waking, because she didn’t want me to wake her (however inadvertently)</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically the only thing we used to do together and still do is sleep together. Gary asks her how her “boys” are doing. She wanted Sean and me to be buddies, to go kayaking together.</p>
<p>Ah. And I make coffee for her in the morning.</p>
