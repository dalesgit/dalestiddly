<h2 id="lydia-in-a-dream-lydia-in-a-dream">Lydia in a dream {#Lydia in a dream}</h2>
<p>Lydia was prominently in my dreams as I slept in late this morning. My main agenda for the day is to get Sunday's sermon in place and a jump on the holy week sermons. Earlier we had determined that the last time I preached on Palm Sunday was 2012. As also Maundy Thursday and Good Friday.</p>
<p>Lydia's presence was perhaps aroused because of the news of Mom's further dramatic decline and return to the hospital. As I had thought from the previous couple of days' conversations, it was the heart failures that precipitated the decision. But Bill reports Steve <a href="Swanson.html">Swanson</a> being present as a personal pilgrimage to death bed stuff. Paul and Shirley were actually working with Bill yesterday as there was a swirl of tasks with Mom's condition: getting her to a doctor's visit and then precipitously to the hospital and not back to Good Sam. Then arise questions about where she will go when she leaves the hospital this time.</p>
<p>I think I was wondering about communicating Mom's condition to Lydia. Wondering about how much she cares. She never responded to my questions about getting together while we were in Ohio. Hardness of heart? So caught up in her own shit?</p>
<p>In the dream we had eaten together. But it was also kind of a presentation of some kind. Lydia wasn't happy about something. Josh was in the background somehow. And I know that Mary Pat was quietly by my side.</p>

<p>I have felt good about cleaning the office and the plant room. Tightened the bookcase, even though I couldn't fix it with glue the way I expected. Tomorrow -- ah, the worry over tomorrow, but letting the present slip through my hands. It's been a lovely day. Some accomplishment. Some creativity -- the Palm Sunday sermon is deliverable. Some rest.</p>

<p>Friday: 3/23</p>
<p>Shirley &amp; Paul are staying til Sunday. Mom rebounded today, similar to the way she did in December/January. They had to check her out of Good Sam, but it seems pretty straight-forward to get her back after she's through at the hospital.</p>
<p>I asked about Shirley and Bill said it was a long story; so it would have to wait for another time. He was headed back to the house after eating out with them. They would be there because Shirley forgot her phone and then he had to call David and Karla.</p>
<p>Oh, it would be hard for me to keep up with Bill has to do.</p>
