<h1 id="counseling-day-2">Counseling Day 2</h1>
<p>Sleep seemed comfortable, but I wondered in the middle of the night about that as Mary Pat grabbed my hand as I slept. It pulled me out of whatever dreaming I was in. I felt comfortable in my sleep but jarred toward waking with her hand. I wondered if I had been groaning or something, maybe snoring?</p>
<p>Perhaps meeting with Erin can be a time of clarifying in my own mind and heart what’s going on.</p>
<p>It’s Sean. It’s Mary Pat. It’s that I’m unhappy. It’s the relationship, surely changed because now there’s three.</p>
<p>I thought of the particular irritation I felt earlier when she would lump Sean and me together as “her guys.” When she wanted me to be Sean’s buddy. To go kayaking with him. When she swaps us out as the kitchen cleaning help.</p>
<p>There’s not room for 3 in the kitchen.</p>
<p>On Tuesday at Clericus Zoom, Sally wondered how or when I could go back to Hawai’i (for a visit). I described what I knew, but the terrible truth for me is that there is no going back. Talking with my student on Zoom yesterday. She was there with the military in 1970. She observed on her own that, “It’s different whether you are visiting or living in Hawai’i.”</p>
<p>I can’t go back to living in Hawai’i, except under extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>Saying that makes me realize there’s another trigger point for me. All the countless times that Mary Pat has responded to the question “Why did you leave Hawai’i.” She has only given her reasons. My reason was always, “I’m going where you’re going.” It was simple for me. Having Sean here was similar. I said, “I don’t see we have a choice but to say,‘Yes’.” But I think I always thought it was going to be problematic, and I think I said, virtually from the beginning, that we have to establish boundaries.</p>
<p>And from the beginning I felt unheard. Royal “we” has never included me. It was always, “We were there for 12 years,” when I was there for 13.</p>
<p>Lydia and Emma still both think of Hawai’i as “home.” It surprised me to hear that from Lydia a few months ago when asking her about her Christmas plans. I suppose it will be so for them as long as Bridget is there. But maybe longer because it was so formative.</p>
<p>I think it was so for me as well.</p>

<p>What to do about “homesickness”? “All sickness is ‘homesickness’.” Ruth gave me the book.</p>
<h1 id="extraordinary-article">Extraordinary article</h1>
<p>Making many profound observations about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/10/28/religion-politics-rebuild-american-democracy/?arc404=true">life and religion</a> I was stunned as I read through the article. It spoke to my religion class about the “mystery”. It spoke to my “homesickness” and my need for peace. It spoke of the loss of “decency” from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/opinion/donald-trump-behavior.html">Brook’s article</a> from the NYTimes. My agitation over the political world we live in …</p>

<li>Courtney with King James – speaking to me opening words</li>
<li>I hear Jesus saying upon seeing the crowd, “I’m out of here.”</li>
<li>Already/but not yet of the message to the disciples</li>
<li>I focused on v. 5, meek, humble, inherit the earth (<strong>humus</strong>)</li>
