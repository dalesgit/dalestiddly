<p>Today was a day like no other. The Capital was stormed by Trump supporters while Congress was counting the certified votes. One person was killed and mayhem ensued.</p>
<p>It was a day like no other in our lifetime. One commentator reported that the last time such a scene took place in the Congress was when Britain burned the Capital during the war of 1812.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-grateful-for">I am grateful for:</h2>
<p>For how much I accomplished aiming at opening my classes. I got a yellow tablet begun with itemized what needs to be done. I’m pretty close, but I was discouraged by how much time was wasted with getting the video recording to work technically.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Democrats won control of the Senate</li>
<li>The GOP traitors took control of the Congress building and mainstream supports vacillated.</li>
<li>I walked out of the room when MP chastised me for standing in the way of Sean while I was trying to playfully say how important I thought it was about the commentator with re. War of 1812. I never got to tell MP the story. I never accepted her repeated, “I’m sorry.” ‘s’ (How to write that?)</li>
<li>We prayed Evening Prayer together for the 2nd night in a row – at MP urging.</li>
<li>I feel tired. Worn out.</li>
<li>That’s how I felt at Karen’s office yesterday at our counseling session.</li>
