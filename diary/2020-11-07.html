<p>I led the two students who screwed up to a solution. I made my walk. I am on the verge of getting below 200 #’s. I am stirring inside, trying to figure out some kind of response to Emma. Biden seems to be slowly progressing towards ending the nightmare of Trump’s presidency.</p>
<h1 id="emma">Emma</h1>
<p>[[20201113081539]] Emma Birthday Letter]] - Your “Fix it Daddy” was in large measure why I made the move to talk to your mother about “What we needed to do for the best interests of the girls.” - I naively thought we would be able to have that conversation. In fact it was the end. She never spoke to me as a husband/father again - I am sending you words because it’s the only thing I have available. - The confusion about even having the possibility. My spiritual director asked me “Why did you think all those years that you didn’t have any contact information?” I wasn’t sure. I guess it was that I sent you messages and got no response. When I asked people who did have good contact information, they told me that you did not want me to know or contact you. - One thing your mother demanded through the separation, into the divorce, was that I pay for college. You may come to recognize that it is not easy to make a change of career when one is over 60. As far as I am aware, most of the men who have faced that over the past decades – and there have been millions of them – have had to take significant cuts in income and quality of life. The women who have faced it have, not surprisingly, fared much worse.</p>
<p>I had been working for some time prior to 2011 trying to find a path for me to provide for you and to engage myself in something worthwhile. Since 1980 I had basically had two kinds of professional work: teaching and pastoring. In many ways that had been my sense of call to priesthood that I had first presented to the bishop of Colorado in the 1970’s.</p>
<p>I was looked for a teaching position. I was not hired by my first choice – teaching at Iolani. But by 2012 I did find a way to begin teaching at Chaminade. I even knew of and talked to several Episcopal priests who had taught there.</p>
<p>When I finally had a teaching contract there, I had a way to completely provide for a college education for both you and Lydia. The contract included a provision for my children to get a full-ride to Chaminade University. Sadly, by that time, you and Lydia had decided that you didn’t want anything to do with me.</p>

<ul>
<li>During a conversation with Bp. Fitzpatrick in 2011 or 2012 about the estrangement from you that caused so much pain that he was aware then that your mother had, to quote him since his words were etched into my soul, “Said things to you two girls that no parent should ever tell the children.” He didn’t tell me what that was. Over the years I have repeatedly asked people who were in a position to know what it was that I did to cause such a rupture. No one has been willing to tell me what they know.</li>
<li>I had one exchange with someone that confirmed for me that what had been told you was profoundly untrue. On the day of your graduation Tim Vail said things to me, in great anger and righteous indignation, that were so bizarre that it felt like he was a patient in an asylum. I knew, of course, that that was not the case and that he felt justified in what he was saying. I knew, that there was some kind of truth being propagated somehow, somewhere, that was utterly and profoundly disconnected from the truth and even reality. There was, of course, no way at that moment, on the grounds of St. Andrew’s, for me to explore what that was all about. All I had was an irrational threat made against me by someone who didn’t know me and was acting on someone else’s testimony.</li>
<li>To this day I do not know what has made you so angry that you wanted to have nothing to do with me.</li>
<li>Someday you may recognize, but maybe not, that as a parent I loved you and cared for you as few fathers are able.</li>
<li>I came to realize through my spiritual director that I had spent much of the 90’s and into the 2000’s staying in the marriage that was in many ways a failure, but staying “for the sake of the children.”</li>
<li>What led me to decisions in 2011 that led to a breakdown of that marriage was becoming persuaded that the best thing for the two of you girls was to end the marriage. I had concluded that the damage being inflicted by modeling such a broken relationship as “normal” was, in the end, doing more damage to you.</li>
<li>I’m not telling you all this because I am trying to put into place some kind of <strong>remedy</strong>. The time has passed for that. I long since gave up trying to persuade you to re-open your relationship with a father who had loved you with all he had. I am sending this to you because you broke the silence by informing me that you intended to get married. You made it clear that you were doing it because my brother had persuaded you that you “should.” You made it clear that you didn’t want to have a relationship with me. But you did say something. And now the wedding has occurred. I am stepping into that space.</li>
<li>There is so much that I could have given you these past 10 years. You have no idea, I think. But that opportunity is gone.</li>
<li>I can give you this, however, looking forward to what might be. Up to my last dying breath I would welcome you with love. I would tell you anything and share anything with you. None of it would be to hurt you and none of it would be self-serving on my part.</li>
<li>It was your birthday, I think maybe 2011 but maybe 2012, when I gave you a gift of kite flying over Honolulu bay. I never heard whether you cashed in the ticket. Then I never heard from you.</li>
<li>It’s funny the things we remember. When I braid my hair each day, regularly notice the dark hairs interspersed like pepper in the salt and pepper. Each time I notice hte dark hairs, I think of you. I associate it with a time that you said to me, “Daddy all your hair isn’t white. There’s lots of dark hair in there.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="worked-on">Worked on</h1>
<p>I worked on 317, using Mindmup to visualize things. Feels like I made lots of progress in fairly short shrift. I was impressed.</p>
<p>I brought amplifier and mixer home. Tested use of recorded music. Impressed by the result. Imagining two computers with two tracks to draw on, one the songs of the liturgy and one instrumental Christmas music.</p>
<p>Biden declared winner. Watching people exuberant on TV, celebrating in ways comparable to when Obama won, others reporting that they have not seen such a thing since fall of Berlin wall, and other iconic events.</p>
<p>My walk included the lecture on Kant’s <strong>Critique of Practical Reason</strong> and Romantic period, especially Schleiermacher.</p>
