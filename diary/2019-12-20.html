<p>I have felt so embarrassed and inadequate at not having a gift in mind for MP. She has some little things for me -- but it's not even that.</p>
<p>In the course of the night I came up with something. A poem, built on the theme of &quot;I wanted it to be beautiful because you are beautiful.&quot; It would be in pieces. I thought of one of them with an <span id="orange"></span><strong>orange</strong> -- &quot;you are succulent&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>orange (succulent)</li>
<li>flower (beautiful)</li>
<li>piece of music (music of the universe)</li>
<li>(delicious) a piece of food</li>
<li>(pleasing to look at) the bird feeder</li>
<li>(smart)</li>
</ul>
