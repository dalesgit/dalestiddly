= Preaching =
In my dreaming before getting up I was *so energized*! I was preaching. Or maybe just putting to paper my sermons. It grew out of reading some of my past sermons as I was trying to figure out the best workflow. Perhaps shifting to _Joplin_. 

But one thing came through. A tremendous enthusiasm for just preaching what I knew -- out of the current events of my real life experiences.

So I was enthused about 4 Advent.

- inexpensive, inexperienced movie people (the little people like me)
- movie that didn't kill metaphor, kill imagination
- the importance of little people from the perspective of the *universe*
- We couldn't talk about God or God's work without metaphor and imagination
	- God is love -- not the kind of love I'm most associated with
	- Happy days -- not the holidays I know
	- Angels that look like cherubs -- "angels often come disguised as teachers" -- but they always are disguised
	- God in the silence -- allowing space for imagination
	- even contemplation which clears out our imagination to let God in

And Christmas Day. The Gretchen Pritchard piece.

- I usually have used that on Easter time.
- Telling of stories is what it's all about
- Jesus is the answer -- but we have to know the question
- It will be all right in the end. If it's not all right yet, it's not the end

And Christmas 1. Logos. 

Just preach what you know, Dale.
