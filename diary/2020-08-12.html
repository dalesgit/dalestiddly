<p>The ease with which I can get a new note started is pretty cool. I am almost at the end of <em>Caring for Words</em> and I don’t want it to end. The author’s so-evident delight with words connects with me in a visceral and nostalgic place, taking me back to the days I memorized huge swaths of poetry, was passionate about George Steiner, was in-spired by Eliot and Yeats, was enthralled with the imaginative force as well as the message of Kierkegaard, thought language <strong>must be</strong> the key to what it meant to be human. After an all-too-ordinary 5 decades on, I can see that much of that, while sophomoric infatuation, provided the foundation for much of the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I have sometimes shared with conversation partners the sense of being overwhelmed with responsibility when I realized in Wauwatosa that the rest of my life would be dependent on the quality of my word craft. I’ve been better than some but mostly just ordinary. </p>
<p>Listening to Mary Chapin Carpenter’s <em>10,000 miles</em>. Sweet music. I think it’s folk-like that is my favorite music. I could listen to that.</p>
