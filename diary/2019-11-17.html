<h1 id="goodbyes-to-gini-goodbyes-to-gini">Goodbyes to Gini {#Goodbyes to Gini}</h1>
<p>For me it was short, but I felt like crying. I said, &quot;Good night, Gini.&quot; She responded by saying, &quot;You'll be back tomorrow won't you?&quot; I said, &quot;No, we're going home for a while.&quot; She said, &quot;Oh, drive safely.&quot; Then she said, &quot;I'll miss you.&quot;</p>
<p>Three sisters hugged me, each trying to convey something through the hug. I thought afterwards that I had felt more honesty and genuine friendship from cousins that I hardly knew while traveling in Florida.</p>
<p>I felt throughout the 7 hours at David Street today that I was disconnected from everybody. That I had nothing to say to anyone. I felt cold. Sterilized. Impotent. Ineffective.</p>
<p>It feels like no one pays particular attention to me. I'm know it's not that no one cares, least of all MP. But I am cut off and my thoughts are ignored, no, rather just not heard. To strangers, Maria in the breakfast room, clerks at Target or Meier, to them I can respond with warmth and playfulness, wit and kindness, and I feel alive.</p>
<p>Part of me feels dead inside.</p>
