<p>The day was Benedict of Nursia. I knocked myself out trying to get the 8-9 enthused about him. It turns out most of them had participated in a class reading []{#St. Benedict’s Toolkit}<strong>St. Benedict's Toolkit</strong> or some such title.</p>
<p>Susan seemed blown away by my example of teaching. I ended with Bart Giametti and the eg. of my having forgot my vestments in Spartanburg and we all screw up on a regular basis and Benedict is about how we keep up at school batting 30%. Several teachers confirmed that the notion of a school where teachers just pour in the knowledge and students don't make mistakes as they grow is absurd.</p>

<p>I got in my head I think the requirements to get the direct file from ox-reveal to work. (../../ is the location in the emacs config file.) Then I just need to make sure that the files all end up 2 directories away from the main ones in the web site.</p>

<li>presentations should work in:
