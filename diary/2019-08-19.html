<p>My little pieces kind of dribbled into the day. The banner was in place when MP walked out in the morning. She had known the day before that I had baked the cake. I had to tell her about Pump House as we returned from church. Her first words in response was, &quot;Did you invite Peter &amp; Christina.&quot; I was upset with myself that, of course, what she would have wanted was not the dinner but the people -- ala &quot;Magic Island.&quot;</p>

<p>Trying to talk heady stuff with Peter felt like it didn't go very far. He mostly was eager to talk about his work. My arguing from my perspective didn't seem to connect. I had too many <span id="parentheses"></span><strong>parentheses</strong> in so that he didn't follow. I made reference to my concern that Elizabeth Schussler-Fiorenza was too often arguing from silence. Peter just looked at me not understanding and not following.</p>
<p>Cf. the principles of feminist criticism from the OT text:</p>
<ul>
<li>looking at unexamined women's roles</li>
<li>looking for the censored and unspoken part of the text</li>
<li>changing the interpretative thrust of the text so that later generations can do better than the exploitation that past generations have done</li>
</ul>
<p>Cf. also the text <em>Sarah, Hagar, and their children</em> where all the authors are feminist theologians: Christian, Jewish, &amp; Muslim.</p>
<p>What is interesting is my seeming need to stretch my thinking, even as MP was feeling left out. All too often I am feeling the same way when she is controlling the conversation.</p>

<ul>
<li>What surprised me today? I had &quot;the perfect mexican lunch.&quot; Chalups, tamil, chile poblano</li>
<li>What inspired me today? The quality of the few programs working on the Linux portion of Chromebook 2</li>
<li>What touched me today? The son and father being reconciled on &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;, the rabbi's words of grace to Max</li>
<li>What did I enjoy doing today? Computer effort to build Marktext on Chromebook 2. Perhaps I'll try another one tomorrow.</li>
<li>What would I like to more of?</li>
<li>What would I like to do less of? Miscommunicate with MP. She asks me, &quot;Do I want to watch...?&quot; and I don't know how to respond. She thinks that she is communicating directly.</li>
<li>What did I learn today? Keep trying to communicate.</li>
<li>What will I do differently tomorrow?</li>

<p>“[]{#This is what you shall do; Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God}<strong>This is what you shall do; Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God</strong>, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body.”</p>
<p>The highlighted part was in last night's Zen reading.</p>
