<h1 id="time-machine-time-machine">Time Machine {#Time Machine}</h1>
<p>We watched []{#The Time Machine}<strong>The Time Machine</strong> last night. I was surprised that it seemed thoughtful and sensitive for a science fiction film. The dialogue was not crazy stilted.</p>
<p>At the end there were two thoughtful questions left with the audience and Mary Pat asked them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Would you have gone back into the future for a love interest? For the reason he seemed to give that he had something to teach or offer the people?</li>
<li>What three books would you have taken from your library?
<ol type="1">
<li>Bible</li>
<li>Shakespeare</li>
<li>Bach's []{#Well Tempered Clavier}<strong>Well Tempered Clavier</strong></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Lydia seemed present in my dreams.</p>
<h1 id="today-was-mueller-testimony-today-was-mueller-testimony">Today was Mueller testimony {#Today was Mueller testimony}</h1>
<p>It seems as though some movement has been made today. Democrats are talking plainly about defending the nation. But the deep divisions in the country? I don't know.</p>
<h1 id="call-from-bill-call-from-bill">Call from Bill {#Call from Bill}</h1>
<p>We did Facetime with Bill, David, &amp; Karla. They had traveled to Las Cruces with hopes that the closing on the house might occur next Tuesday. Karla had a neurologist appointment and then they drove on from there. David accompanied him because Bill shouldn't even be putting weight on his foot yet.</p>
<p>The irrigation system had put into place had malfunctioned. Hal had taken care of the lawn. Charlene's mother died earlier in the year. In her mourning Charlene has spent her time in El Capitan.</p>
<p>He remembered that I had expressed interest at our last time together at the house in the prints of women on the walls. He would have to give them to Goodwill. As he might the china cabinet since no one wants it.</p>
<p>He said that he had not called me because I had not called him. My calling left him able to call.</p>
<p>It was good to be able to see the 3 of them and to catch glimpses of the house.</p>
<p>Mary Jean has gone to Kansas. David, and then Bill, were concerned about things that may have been left in the house in Wheatridge. In particular they were concerned about a painted portrait of our grandmother. David had suggested that Owen would be a good person to have it. Bill and I both agree, but we will not talk to Shirley about it.</p>
<p>David talked about how he has been working on Emma to call her father -- as per my suggestion. David reported that Emma remembered me as the person who braided their hair -- this was after Mary Pat showed them pictures of my hair. It was the same story of 1 year ago. He said -- probably accurately -- that he was the one closest to Emma. He reported that she has asked about our Dad as well as asking about me. I asked if he knew anything about Lydia and all any of them knew was that Lydia had broken up with her boy friend. [I thought that they don't have a clue what's really going on with Lydia -- only her father knows about that, and she doesn't talk to him.</p>
