<h1 id="travel-dream">Travel dream</h1>
<p>So this morning I’ve had a familiar kind of dream, but there was a difference with re. MP. Though maybe not different, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>I was trying to fly back home – I told the people, “To Hawai’i.” I got through a lot of the security stuff before I realized that I had forgot to return the rental car. So, I had got myself to the airport on time. In the past I often was unable to meet the time constraint. Security seemed to be a matter of putting all kinds of stuff onto a conveyor belt that was searched through with big sticks.</p>
<p>I had been in the dream for a while, things going more or less as planned. Mary Pat left before me. At the end of the dream I was bemoaning the fact that my wife had gone home early, but I had needed her to keep track of details like dealing with the car.</p>
<p>I wake up thinking about the presence of the hulking man in my house and how I really don’t like it. And I thought of Jacob. I remembered the really good times I had with him when he was a boy. He and I went to school together when he was in elementary still, going to the Catholic school across the street. I wondered how things went so bad. “Fuck you up the ass” to the daughter of the senior warden was one time, if not the first, when I felt I had been pushed into a corner where there was no room to be flexible. My principle at that point was that church needed to be safe for everyone. Jacob had made it not safe. The senior warden’s daughter part was secondary in my mind, but not unimportant. Then, eventually, he instilled a violence in the house that I couldn’t tolerate.</p>
<p>It seems like it’s the presence of a man that is as bothersome as anything. The main loss I’ve experienced is the “we” part. Sean hasn’t intruded into our life. Maybe it’s my fault. But Sean has taken “us” away. MP has wanted there to be a new “us” – with 3 instead of 2. I don’t want it. In fact, I guess, I reject it. I’m not going there.</p>
<p>So, I see some of my task as forging “my” space, figuratively as well as literally.</p>
