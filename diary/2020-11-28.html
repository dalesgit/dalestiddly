<p>The question I can think to ask is: “What could I do that would persuade you to stay in the marriage?”</p>

<p>Dreaming about being in a busy place, like a convention. I was alone and carrying something important. A part of it fell apart into little screws and springs. In a balcony sort of place, spread under the chairs, I was trying to gather the pieces. It was time for me to go (escape?) but I was struggling.</p>
