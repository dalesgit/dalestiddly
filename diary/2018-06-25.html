<p>Things I accomplished today, modest as they may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the html container for the markdown content for the reveal presentations for Winthrop is ready to go. It is portable and does not need a context to work. It needs a server environment because of the markdown file.</li>
<li>I refined my orgmode config file for emacs</li>
<li>installed mupdf for use with emacs and otherwise. Wow is it fast.</li>
<li>laundry, made the bed, ate a frog, made dinner, did the dishes</li>
<li>made a sketch of what is needed in my personal web page and in BlackBoard</li>
</ul>
