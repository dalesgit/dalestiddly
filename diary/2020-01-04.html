<p>Dreaming</p>
<p>I was in a kind of jail or a &quot;favella.&quot; I was being punished for something. I had been kind to someone and inherited the care of a sort of infant. It was tiny, fit into a sock, so it was kind of strange. But in the storied fashion of prisoners, the little girl was precious to me. I tried to protect it at all costs.</p>
