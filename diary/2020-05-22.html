<h1 id="today-worked-on-today-worked-on">Today Worked on {#Today Worked on}</h1>
<ul>
<li>Refined my course objectives in certification course.</li>
<li>Nearly completed the rubric for discussion threads</li>
<li>worked on how to get the rubric into the discussion thread assignment.</li>
<li>not yet done is associating a rubric with a course objective -- don't know where that is.</li>
<li>talked with Peter about fall courses. Decided that I will teach whatever I get online. Mary Pat is keenly critical of WU. She has been depressed today -- saying that no one reaches out to her. Feeling alone, etc. She said that the only person who reaches out and asks her immediately how she is, is Sean.</li>
<li>She talked to Walter Cotter who she found out has retired. She was so animated. It reminded me of how I used to be very jealous of their chemistry.</li>
<li>learned how to get the relevant links for the discussion threads -- I may need to revise my discussion assignment.</li>
