<h1 id="prayer-time">Prayer time?</h1>
<p>Today and yesterday MP and I have each observed Give us this day – but independently. I imagine her saying, “Dale was the one who ended our corporate prayer time.” And I would say, I can’t pray with someone who doesn’t honor the sacred nature of the prayer time.</p>
<p>As usual hers is the easier to explain.</p>
<h1 id="confrontation-with-mp">Confrontation with MP</h1>
<p>From the earliest morning she had marginalized me and not communicated. Obviously upset and angry. As she came around the corner while I was playing the piano, she had been napping I think, I stopped her and said, I don’t understand why you are so angry.</p>
<p>She responded that she wasn’t angry but very sad. I took it to be sad at the ending of – I could only surmise she meant our marriage.</p>
<p>I said that I feel like I can’t infringe on her and her family. And that I can’t respond with anything regarding Sean.</p>
<p>She implies that I have resisted counseling or that it’s my fault that we didn’t see a counselor before Sean arrived.</p>
<p>She asks me, “Have I forgiven Sean?” She asks, “Do you know how you have hurt Sean?” This after I have talked about how I recognize Sean hasn’t hurt me very much, so forgiveness is easy. I responded to the above with, “Does he recognize how he’s hurt me.” I had in mind all the things that were stolen from me as I was living with MP. I recognize that MP was throwing at me that I hurt Sean – informing me that he was playing the injured party? Or was that just her interpretation? I don’t know.</p>
<p>I know that I have no say, now, in Sean’s place here. She had started off saying that, “Sean is doing all that he can. He’s going to meetings most nights.” And I just felt the need to say, “It’s not most nights. It’s maybe a majority of nights.” I didn’t say that it’s like court-ordered meetings. It’s in the context of his mother has to drive him to and from the meetings.</p>
<hr />
<p>She said, “I will do anything to save this marriage.” I said that I feel the same way. Then after thinking a while I said, “I guess I’m not willing to lose my soul.” She responded with saying, “I am not willing to lose my self.” That phrase I took to be similar to what she has said about what happened in her marriage to Doug. She went on to say, “I’m not willing to sacrifice my son.” She added that she would be willing to do anything to help her son.</p>
<p>How can anyone not agree to that? But it feels a little like she understands me to be asking her to sacrifice him. I have felt that I did this with Bridget’s son, Jacob, and I don’t feel like doing it now 30 years later.</p>
<p>She has sent me the phone number of her place. So I am supposed to get a counselor for me and then we will arrange a third counselor. The MSW’s take medicaid payment but not the psychologists.</p>
<p>It has just felt like MP was interested in throwing everything back at me. Always responding to me with, “No. …” Whatever I say will be turned against me. Oh so familiar.</p>
<p>She said she wanted to run away.</p>
<p>She said several times that she didn’t want to talk any more because we just kept hurting one another.</p>
<p>Finally she said that she didn’t know what else to say that wouldn’t be hurtful.</p>
<p>She said she wants us (i.e. Sean and she and I) to be a <strong>team</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="is-it-my-fear-moment">Is it my FEAR moment?</h1>
<p>I feel like shrugging and giving up with the statement, “I can’t trust her not to hurt me.” I don’t feel any hope that she could understand me. And for the most part I think she will do whatever she can to hurt me. Her way of winning. So often over the past months (years?) she has constantly berated other people, what they don’t get. I guess now it comes home to roost.</p>
<p>She said something that was almost, “I’m so sad that it hasn’t worked out between us.” I suspect that, in the end, I had a greater commitment to this marriage than she because for her it was too much along the lines of “as long as it is good for us/me.”</p>
<p>I’ve really lost a lot of hope tonight.</p>
<h1 id="later-thoughts">Later thoughts</h1>
<p>MP’s claim that things were really bad between us, dating to long before Sean got here, is belied by my memory, at least, of our trip to Florida. Yea, even the whole of the summer leading up to the trip. I remember Florida as a very positive experience. Almost buying a property. Time with Martha and husband. Naples and the sun and the beach and bicycle. The Everglades. So much sharing of adventure and anticipation and hope and future visioning. Julian joining us. And even the thing that separated us was a joint commitment to being with Gini.</p>
<p>I am inclined to conclude (indeed I thought of it above) that the focus on negative feelings is mis-placed and a projection of current disillusionment.</p>
<h1 id="death">Death?</h1>
<p>I fear you may be right, my dearest love. I fear that maybe something has died today. I grieve with you.</p>
