<h1 id="sisters-5-sisters">5 sisters {#5 sisters}</h1>
<p>I learned yesterday that Beth was glad that I wasn't here. When a comment was made, &quot;What about Howie?&quot; it was swept underneath the rug. Then I learned that Katie and Beth both remembered a time that (as they put it) I had <span id="yelled"></span><strong>yelled</strong> at them. I remember vaguely the two events. Both times I thought they were being unreasonably mean to Mary Pat and I said something. In neither case would &quot;<span id="yelling"></span><strong>yelling</strong>&quot; be the appropriate word to use, but <span id="critical"></span><strong>critical</strong> might be.</p>
<p>It all has such obvious echoes for me of Theresa (<span id="Didi"></span><strong>Didi</strong>) telling me that I []{#didnâ€™t have a right to speak in their house}<strong>didn't have a right to speak in their house</strong> that it is impossible to ignore its emotional impact.</p>
<p>I know they &quot;love&quot; me. And I know that there are []{#family rules}<strong>family rules</strong> about what you can talk about and what you can't that feel like <span id="anathema"></span><strong>anathema</strong> and heresy to me. I also recognize, as Julian observed, that all families have different ways of dealing with stuff. As Mary Pat has observed countless times, at least her family talks to one another.</p>
