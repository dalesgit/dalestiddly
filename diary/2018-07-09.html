<p>I really enjoyed myself. I felt privileged being there. Fear of being an over-bearing white liberal.</p>
<p>Once I got to the hall it was weird. There were certain trappings of a not unusual meal sort of reception. But nobody was there! The person I had talked to, the treasurer was in another room with -- was it the Bishop's Warden?</p>
<p>Then the whole thing got colored by the fact that I ended up leaving my vestments there. Grrr!</p>
