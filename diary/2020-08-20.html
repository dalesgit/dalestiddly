<p>RELG dept. via Zoom</p>
<p>Syllabus policy: cp. re. Covid issues added. Grading policy re. D’s as from Spring 20. Attendance statement. Kat Wilson is pulling together things for our college. Culminating experience should be done during exam week. Some statements to include with re. masks etc. Protocol for if the student refuses. Peter’s decision is that if refusal then he will leave.</p>
<p>Discussion: Greg said need to talk to Jeannie and cleaning staff. Enforce break room needs to be masked.o</p>
<p>OK to have a link in BlackBoard.</p>
<p>cf. “section 4” re. Covid policy related to faculty. e.g. classroom etc. Still in Phase 2. Not a full complement of staff on campus. Grading same as Spring.</p>
<p>Sanitizing. There will be spray bottles in classes. Spray surfaces as entering into classroom. Perhaps new guidance forthcoming? The spray should sit for 1 minute on surface. No particular need to wipe down. Peter was going to go out and buy gloves. Jeannie herself may be going in to each classroom to sanitize. Supplies in office for use in each individual office.</p>
<p>Class needs <strong>8 to “make”</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten’s 300 level courses are full. Something has only 8.</p>
<p>They are in the process of substituting desktops with laptops. They are putting docking stations in the classroom – plugin your own computer. Should be document cameras in each classroom. In case of going remote they are available to checkout.</p>
<p>Are we supposed to record for students who have to isolate? Peter says that’s up to instructor. E.g. can use Collaborate Ultra to meet with them? Compensation available for faculty who get sick?</p>
<p>Issue re. shifting Zoom account.</p>
<p>We now have 8 minors and 9 majors. We graduated 10 in Spring (had 20 then.)</p>
<p>Jill Lauber, person in Dean’s office re. issues with things that don’t seem right.</p>
<p>Captstone papers, divide up for secondary readers. I am down for 2 papers: Trinity and Atonement. Rubric and list sent Greg. <strong>Due sept. 8.</strong> Rubrics are a 4 (3-0) point scale. Average of “satisfactory” would be acceptable (Greg).</p>
<p>Office copying machine. Avoid as much paper use as possible. Protocol re. use of photocopier: each person do own work, but spray the touch area of copier.</p>
<p>Alexis is now working with 3 departments.</p>
<p>Same procedures are going to be in place for Spring. Online or hybrid we need to decide.</p>
<p>Schedule changes due back by Sept. 7.</p>
<p>Peter has no idea when a decision might be forthcoming about possible return to face-to-face. Greg: Probably unless the state does something we’re likely to be back together by Sept. xx. Factors: give faculty more time to prepare, watching state campuses adjust, waiting to secure returning students. “Controlling the message is a challenge.” Mixed messaging: both too much information and not enough – e.g. don’t have Zoom information yet.</p>
<p>Peter/Greg: more and more students asking for online classes. Almost flip-flopped from the beginning. Probably more info after Friday’s meeting of faculty.</p>
<p>11 am on Monday on Blackboard – be available for new students. Maybe just 1 student. Link for meetings and then “break out rooms” to meet new students (From Adrienne.)</p>
