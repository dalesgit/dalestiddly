<p>I am reading <em>Caring Word</em> and in particular the section on **stories. **They are living and vital to human life and to our particular lives – they are <strong>life-stories</strong> after all. I was struck by how my marriage to Bridget ended when I could no longer see or understand an ending to our <strong>story</strong> together. I said to Dick Hubbard that, “I can’t imagine growing old with her.” What I was in touch with was the notion of her caring for me in a time of dependency or weakness was repulsive to me. What I just thought in my reading this morning is that it was about <strong>story</strong>. Our story had ended, I guess. </p>
<p>I didn’t know, at the time, that the story continued with violence and destruction that I couldn’t imagine. In the same way I couldn’t imagine anyone behaving the way Shirley did at Mom’s funeral. I have, of course, come to realize that there are many people who have that relationship to family. I encountered it the other day in a story prompted by Mary Trump’s exposé on the Trump family. It referenced, e.g., <em>Mommy Dearest</em> and other Hollywood “tell-alls”.</p>
