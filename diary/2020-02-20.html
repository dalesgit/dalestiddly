<p>Leviticus 19:13-16 (taken from MP today)</p>
<p>You shall not exploit your neighbor. You shall not commit robbery. You shall not withhold overnight the wages of your laborer. You shall not insult the deaf, or put a stumbling block in front of the blind, but you shall fear your God. I am the Lord.</p>
<p>You shall not act dishonestly in rendering judgment. Show neither partiality to the weak nor deference to the mighty, but judge your neighbor justly. You shall not go about spreading slander among your people; nor shall you stand by idly when your neighborâ€™s life is at stake. I am the Lord.</p>

<p>This reading reminded me on multiple counts of the message I gave at church about my father's lessons to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>as comfortable with low as with high</li>
<li>my incensed rejection of the mocking going on in our culture</li>
<li>the deadly power of words</li>
<li>reach out to help others</li>
<li>judge fairly (that's the power of the students who castigate me with, &quot;It's not fair.&quot;)</li>
</ul>
