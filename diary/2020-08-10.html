<p>I feel inspired to do more because of the reading <em>Caring for Words</em>. I feel motivated to write, to work with words.</p>
<p>I feel deeply sad that I will not likely get to live by the ocean now that Sean appears to be a long-term resident. I couldn’t possibly say, “No”, but I am very disappointed.</p>

<p>I like to think we remember and honor St. Lawrence not only for his defiance of unjust authority, but most especially for his deep understanding of the love of Christ. It is said that when a Roman official intent on material gain demanded that Lawrence hand over the treasury of his church, Lawrence begged for a little time. Then he gathered the neediest people of the congregation, the impoverished, the widowed and abandoned, the disabled and sick. He presented them to the official, saying, “Here are the treasures of the church.” Lawrence paid for this with his life, but he made his point. <strong>Kathleen Norris</strong> in <em>Give us this day</em>.</p>
