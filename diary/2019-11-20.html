<p>It seems like a terrible cold wind is blowing through me right now. I'm sure MP doesn't understand. Her <span id="demand"></span><strong>demand</strong> that I make an appointment by today felt like a demand made at gun point, without any regard for me as a person. I would never claim that's what MP was doing but that's what it felt like to me. &quot;Home&quot; doesn't feel like a <span id="safe"></span><strong>safe</strong> place. The whole unresolved money issue where I have no money that is my own never quite goes away. MP has never understood that. So much of our life is simply her call. She thinks that asking me for input and then she makes the decision is perfectly adequate. And I am ok with relinquishing the major financial decisions.</p>
<p>Much of this was my own doing, wasn't it?</p>
