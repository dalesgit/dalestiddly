<p>Lunch with Sue Parker</p>
<p>Issues identified underlying her reactivity. We were agreed that what she needs to find is peace. She said she was at a place not good and the only similar time was going through her divorce. What got her through it at the time was that God began speaking to her and that has brought her up to the present time. For the moment God is being silent for her. Her option in case the Diocese rejects her is a friend at the Lutheran Pacific seminary.</p>
<p>She had root canal surgery and the pain has not gone away, possibly from the bone being ...</p>
<p>Anger and hurt. She will write some of that down so that she can begin to let go of it.</p>
<p>The goal is to be ready to deal with the committee on October 13. The anger hurt and resentment have a lot to do with a sense of being jerked around by the Diocese and their new plan for which she and three others are guinea pigs.</p>
<p>I pressed her in several ways about how she is so negative about students, asking her how she might learn from them. It really seemed to me that the emotion that she projected onto students was coming from somewhere else.</p>

<p>MP and I made a decision to get storage (if ideally for a short period) to enable getting me out of my office. This felt good because we were able to say, &quot;Yes,&quot; without a lot of conditions. She deferred to me and clearly wants it to be short term, but there seems to be an awareness that we need to do this.</p>
<p>Writing and reflection.</p>
<p>The reasons for teaching as an adjunct really don't add up. The reason for doing it is to keep my intellectual life alive.</p>
<p>Bob Fitzpatrick finally responded to my email. He is such a controlling ass. So much wrong with his leadership. But let it go, Dale. Focus on what gives you joy.</p>

<p>The default for Ubuntu (and others?) is that it's not allowed to run xorg apps from su/sudo. This was the case with the &quot;Linux apps&quot; in the Acer chromebook. They are allowed with a line in the .profile file (from Arch <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Running_GUI_applications_as_root" class="uri">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Running_GUI_applications_as_root</a>)</p>
