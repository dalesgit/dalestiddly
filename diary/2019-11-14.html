<h1 id="Treachery">Treachery</h1>
<p>I stumbled on the word last night talking with MP, but it seems the best word for what the sisters and Beth in particular have done to MP. Beth told her she wasn't welcome in the family home. No one perceives or recognizes the pecularity of &quot;Dale &amp; Pat visiting from a motel room.&quot; Last night Gini asked both of us whether we were staying at the house. I had a tender time with her as I read the &quot;Prayer for Quietness.&quot; Perhaps the siblings gabbing away in her presence there in the living room would have noticed the love and tenderness, even the peace, as I gently touched her hands, holding onto the wooden prayer cross Mary Pat had given her, and spoke of God's peace. Probably not, though.</p>
<p>I have said to myself as a response to one of the siblings trying to welcome me that, &quot;I don't like snakes. And especially poisonous ones.&quot;</p>
