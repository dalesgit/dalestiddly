<p>So much clutter! It doesn't feel like home except that this is where all our/my stuff is. Almost 4 days of Julian here. What do we do?</p>

<p>_From []{#Give Us this Day}<strong>Give Us this Day</strong> for Nov. 2. I read the opening paragraphs without seeing who wrote it. And I was thinking, &quot;That is exactly the sentiment I have expressed to people when I tell them about the Colorado Mountain Club mantra to leave the wilderness as you found it. I have thought that even Genghis Khan should have taken that approach to living. And humility as a core habit, virtue, characteristic -- and recognize that I am rather more on the other end of the spectrum. Nevertheless ...</p>
<p>And then I saw that it was Thomas Merton who wrote it and I was humbled.</p>
<p>[]{#The Jubilant Dead All Pray}<strong>The Jubilant Dead All Pray</strong></p>
<p>In the cemetery I looked up at the sky and thought of the great sea of graces that was flowing down on Gethsemani as her hundredth year was ending. All the crosses stood up and spoke to me for fair this time. It was as if the earth were shaking under my feet and as if the jubilant dead were just about to sit up and sing.</p>
<p>And I got some taste of how much there is to be glad for in the world. . . . Not that I am looking for any such taste anymore: only how to serve God better and belong more completely to Him.</p>
<p>Father Amadeus was speaking today of the need for a concrete spiritual ideal. What strikes me is the need of something absolutely concrete and definite—poverty, humility: not something abstract, off in the heavens, but here. . . . Not for other people first, but for myself first. To make it a real ideal you work for, not just one you occasionally think and preach about. To ask God somehow to make me the quietest and meekest and most unobtrusive man in the whole house, the poorest man, the one with nothing. I am right at the other end of the pole from that—but in the circumstances God has given me to work with, there are still graces—and all the Fathers of Gethsemani, whom I love, will all pray for me.</p>

<p>Julian was so patient with me: while walking and I was in pain and had to pee; while playing / learning disc golf. The dinner was so luscious, but marred by the fact the server (named Julian) forgot the pupus. He would have been able to help with the locks, saying it's easy.</p>
<p>I want to do more of being with Julian.</p>
