<h1 id="scott-jansen-called-scott-jansen-called">Scott Jansen called {#Scott Jansen called}</h1>
<p>Scott called. We had a 1 1/2 hour call. He is on a sleep apnea machine every day. He has to augment with oxygen because of his lung damage.</p>
<p>Main reason for the call was to report that he got a call from Brian that &quot;he is an alcoholic and needs help.&quot; But he is afraid of losing his job if he seeks help. Will he lose his wife and child? and One on the way.</p>
<p>Searching for a response, I connected the theme of powerlessness to the sometimes impossible task of being a parent. Thinking of Emma in particular, I remember the way in which they were my sun and moon. My love ran and continues to run very deep. And yet I'm powerless to overcome the distance between us. Just so Scott is powerless to do anything to <span id="save"></span><strong>save</strong> Brian.</p>
<p>There will be things along the way he can do, however, like accompany him to an AA meeting. Look up and confirm that there is an EAP for his company. He can provide &quot;brutal honesty.&quot;</p>
