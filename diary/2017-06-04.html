<p>It is Pentecost. The receptionist yesterday asked us if we were going to church today! I told her that was a first for me. But when I explained about Pentecost and baptism of my children she clearly didn't have a clue.</p>
<p>&gt; Dear children, Everyday I pray for my children, each of you in your own ways are courageously forging the life you are called to live. Generally I add, &quot;The ones who talk to me and the ones who don't.&quot; On this, the anniversary of baptism for all of you, I can simply rejoice to <em>remember</em> each of you on the occasion of your baptism. Right now we're in Atlanta and the receptionist, who attends a famous <span id="mega-church"></span><strong>mega-church</strong> in the neighborhood, and, while being a passionate Christian in her own style, she didn't have a clue what I was talking about when I shared a little of your story. Today I rejoice and celebrate the life of each one of you. Thanks be to God. <span id="P.S."></span><strong>P.S.</strong>: I would be grateful for those of you who know Emma's contact information that you would pass on this greeting and blessing. Thank you.</p>
<p>There is something: There is</p>
