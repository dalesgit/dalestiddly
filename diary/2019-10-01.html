<p>We have arrived in Birmingham. We have talked a lot with Joan and Ed. I was quickly reminded of Ed's Parkinson disease. At one point I asked what he got up for in the morning. His answer was that it was to do all the things he's doing to try to stave off defeat at the hands of his disease enemy.</p>
<p>We spent the afternoon quietly taking in the solemnity of the []{#Legacy civil rights museum}<strong>Legacy civil rights museum</strong> and the <span id="Memorial"></span><strong>Memorial</strong>. It, e.g.Â emphasized the direct`link between slavery as indentured work force to the practice of giving the labor of convicts to various commercial interests -- I can't remember the name for it. Oh, my God, it's the same thing the Nazi's did with their work camps.</p>
<p>I want to try to incorporate slavery into the unit on Religion and Evil.</p>
