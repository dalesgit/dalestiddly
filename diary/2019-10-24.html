<p>Walking the edge of the ocean, occasionally rocked by the force of the wave remnant, sinking in the sand, the cool water now warm on my skin, I could begin to rest in a little bit of self-reflection. I wondered, []{#Why do I get up in the morning? What am I living for?}<strong>Why do I get up in the morning? What am I living for?</strong> Obviously shades of Mom's reflections, but closer to home I thought about how I looked intently into a future trajectory as I walked the beach in Hawai'i. At Mokule'ia. On Molokai with the bishop candidates. Waikiki, even with Mary Pat by my side. But now there seems to be a lot of blank.</p>
