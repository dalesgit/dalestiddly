<p>Her dying has been anticipated for a couple of days. She was always in my memory a positive image in a family that in other ways seemed so tarnished. A tough woman. A matriarch. Lots of boys. And so she reminded me of Mom.</p>
<p>And Mom is dying at 92. Though Bill reports that Charlene reports that she did better yesterday. So typical of Mom's saga.</p>
<p>But I think that deeper down than I have gone in recent weeks, the anticipation of her death is sinking in. Not with regrets. With sadness. With poignance. With a feel for some of the &quot;might-have-beens.&quot; Quite a sense of <span id="loss"></span><strong>loss</strong> I guess. But also an awareness that I got much of my sense of love from the woman. For better or worse.</p>
