<h1 id="Moving">Moving</h1>
<p>Yesterday Mary Pat made reference in conversation with someone on the trip to the Everglades that &quot;when we move to Florida ...&quot; I acted a little surprised and said, &quot;We haven't had that discussion.&quot; She responded, saying, &quot;I thought we had. We were going to buy a house in Palm Harbor ...&quot;</p>
<p>I know that sometimes she imagines that things have been discussed and settled. I know that she often says, &quot;I thought that ...&quot; whatever it was that she was predisposed to believe. I often think on those occasions that she doesn't listen to me at all.</p>
<p>I got up a little early because I was just going over and over in my head the notion that I was about to move to Florida.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I always thought of South Carolina as a temporary stay.</li>
<li>I just got through getting back my role as a teacher and Mary Pat has made the decision to move.</li>
<li>None of my concerns with regard to dealing with our house are taken seriously: refrigerator, door, carpet, garage door.</li>
<li>I know she does want to please me, but she is often dismissive of me, ignoring my talking, pointedly interrupting me in conversations so that others know []{#whoâ€™s in charge.}<strong>who's in charge.</strong></li>
<li>Sometimes I feel like everything I say, from minor to major, she will refute or start off with how I'm wrong or not quite right. She will presume that I am asking her to []{#fix it}<strong>fix it</strong>.</li>
</ol>
