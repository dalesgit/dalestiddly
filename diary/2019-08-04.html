<h1 id="amy-and-siamese-dream-in-asheville-amy-and-siamese-dream-in-asheville">Amy and Siamese Dream in Asheville {#Amy and Siamese Dream in Asheville}</h1>
<p>Stayed up very late in order to be able to drive Patch's truck down to venue to pick up her equipment. Once when I dropped it off and again during the concert some middle-aged men expressed to me their real admiration for Amy. It was wonderful to be able to lift her up and to express our support and pride in what she is doing.</p>
<p>The band is sort of losing its guitarist, however, as he is moving to Nashville to advance his career.</p>
<h1 id="boomers-source-of-all-thats-wrong-boomers-source-of-all-thats-wrong">Boomers source of all that's wrong {#Boomers source of all thatâ€™s wrong}</h1>
<p>At a certain point in conversation with Amy I light-heartedly made the statement (mock fashion addressed to Mary Pat), &quot;Of course it's the boomers who are the source of all that's wrong with the world.&quot;</p>
<p>What surprised me was that Amy responded without any irony in her face at all that, &quot;Yes, that's true.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought of Owen and his convictions about Libertarianism, the fall of the American Empire, his effort to be unlike his father at all costs.</p>
<p>Then I tried to reflect on how much can be blamed on our generation, the generation that, even as we are moving out of the echelons of power and influence, we have been at the forefront of just about everything in the US -- and through its influence -- the rest of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>[]{#exploitation of the planet}<strong>exploitation of the planet</strong>: We have certainly acted selfishly and privileged, but we hardly started the pattern</li>
<li>[]{#self-centered policies}<strong>self-centered policies</strong>: we have accelerated, perhaps, the focus on self that was so wonderfully satirized with Noel Stookey's song about <span id="self"></span><strong>self</strong>.</li>
<li>[]{#exploitation of others}<strong>exploitation of others</strong>: from the community sacrifice of the &quot;greatest generation&quot; and the &quot;silent generation&quot; that followed (1922-42), we got <span id="us"></span><strong>us</strong>. Did we kill the communitarian spirit in America? What motivated me, from young adulthood through my career was the opposite. But as a generation, perhaps the case could be made.</li>
<li>[]{#use of guns?}<strong>use of guns?</strong>. How quickly the Haight turned from &quot;flower power&quot; to Charles Manson.</li>
<li><span id="Presidents"></span><strong>Presidents</strong>. We got a single term of Jimmy Carter and then 2 of Obama. But the others?</li>
