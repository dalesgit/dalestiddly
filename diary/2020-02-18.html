<p>Every grading system that I know of that seeks to integrate percentages and letter grades has to deal with trade-offs in the formulae that do the work. One such in the system I use in grading exams occurs when one puts a number on answers for which the student has not provided any answer. It has seemed to me to be unfair that the grade one gives an answer that is deficient would have the same numeric value as where the student doesn't even make an attempt to answer. However, in conversations with students after our first exam, I have decided to change the formula I use for grading the essays -- at least for this exam. Questions that were left blank will receive the numeric value of 60% (on a 1-100 scale).</p>
<p>The result is that the final grade for a good many of you will be higher than what was on the note attached to your exam. No one's grade is lowered by changing the formula. You can see your revised grade by looking at BlackBoard.</p>
