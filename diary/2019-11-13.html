<p>MP has made good progress working back into her family. Beth is strongest holdout. I think Annie was behind it also because it feels like her personality fingerprints on it, particularly the part about reading someone else's intentions and drawing conclusions from it.</p>
<p>I continue to think the move was one of the meanest things I've seen in families. Particularly in light of my mantra that in death and grieving you don't get any do-overs. MP's love is rejected.</p>
<p>I suspect it's a product of Beth's attempt to play God in the process of her mother's death. She feels a great burden and that it's all on her. In the course of it, if she has to hurt other people -- so be it.</p>
<p>Dinner with Mark and Mary was therapeutic for mP. I am able to speak their language so I am comfortable with them. MP had told me that it was not helpful when I spoke in judgment against her family. So there's a place I can't talk. Then there's my own sense of having lost a family -- I can't share that here. My only goal was to support MP in her effort to be present in the course of her mother's dying -- but I'm left with limited options and even []{#No Win}<strong>No Win</strong> choices.</p>
