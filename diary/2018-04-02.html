<p>First day back in class. Both of us feel so weary. The first class went OK. Then in the 2nd class, before I could get to the video, the projector connection blipped out. There was nothing to do it seemed to me. I had reached the end of my basic Islam 101 presentation. I begin a video. Happily I had posted the link to the presentation which had a link to the Youtube videos. Perhaps some of them will in fact do what I asked, namely watch the video.</p>
<p>How would I test this?</p>
