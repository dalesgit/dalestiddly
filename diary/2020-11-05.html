<h1 id="dream-on-awakening">Dream on awakening</h1>
<p>I was somehow with a young woman. We were both trying to get somewhere. Did we have to catch a plane? We were in a place that was a mélange of places I’ve known. We were both a part of something, like we were both Episcopal priests or something. But we wanted to get in a run before we got to our destination. There was traffic and congestion, routes to figure out. We headed somewhere but then got picked up by a car with pastry family to give us a lift. We got out and headed out for our run when I awoke.</p>
<p>I didn’t have equipment. I was going to have to run in my bare feet. I anticipated the route up ahead where there was a rocky, mountainous area. I thought I can do this. She was better equipped and was up ahead of me.</p>
<p>After awakening I wondered, “Who was the woman?” I had no emotional investment in her at all. I wondered if it was anticipating my session today with Linda S.? She did prompt some significant self-examination last month. I’m grateful. I haven’t got better, but I think I’ve made a good beginning.</p>
<p>The blow that Emma was married last week was difficult emotionally yesterday. I feel: hurt, angry, hopeless about family affairs, wondering to God “Why? After the huge investment in loving that I made in those girls”, suspicious of my family who won’t tell me why Emma is so cut off.</p>
<p>Mary Pat had said yesterday, “Emma doesn’t look like any of the rest of your kids.” I responded yes, I’ve known that a long time. They other 2 girls are not very connected to me, but they’re not utterly alienated the way Emma is.</p>
<p>The deeper question I have is something like, “What did I do wrong?” But it’s too late in life to correct the behavior. Is it too late in life for a reconciliation? How would I do that?</p>

<ul>
<li>MP “watch”</li>
<li>DH “Keep away”</li>
<li>Courtney “tarry”</li>
<li>MP you have to do the work yourself to be ready</li>
<li>We spend so much time worrying about whether the coffee is hot rather than the presence of God (in the ordinary)</li>
<li>DH: cf. The session with Linda: identify what is the olive oil in my life.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conversation">Conversation</h1>
<p>We had a reasonable conversation tonight about the holidays. I had said that I was concerned about our exposure – pointing to e.g. Sean’s vulnerability – but that I thought she was more concerned. Therefore if she could identify what she was comfortable with that would decide how we should proceed. She was able to receive my suggestion that the best way for her to process things was to identify what she is comfortable with and to leave off trying to persuade Amy to do anything.</p>
<h1 id="linda-follow-up">Linda follow-up</h1>
<p>I was explaining why I had tentatively decided to not teach anymore after next semester. She asked, “Why?” I tried to explain about the dissatisfaction with online teaching. I told her how even the Zoom sessions on Wednesday had felt like a conversation – even a Zoom! And she responded,</p>
<p>So it is <strong>relationships</strong> that are important to you? And I had to agree. I related how I said at Iolani, that after a summer I had fallen in love with all the students, even the rascals.</p>
<p>I’ve got to <strong>show up</strong>. That was Ruth Yoshioka’s phrase as well.</p>
<p>Cf. here the notes I took after our session (in Joplin).</p>
