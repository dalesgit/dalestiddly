<h1 id="Alienation">Alienation</h1>
<p>Dreaming I was in the mountains, foothills. I was doing a lot of running (physical). I'd been a part of some kind of conference or retreat. There was an issue getting into and out of the complex. I had betrayed the person I was with. I was trying to make it better. To repair the break. I couldn't. I had used Mary Pat's Miata but I had lost it. I couldn't find it. I was frantic.</p>
<p>Reflecting a little the day yesterday that was filled with alienation. Things that set me off included MP saying, &quot;I shouldn't have told you that.&quot; It reflects a self censorship that I somehow associate with the brokeness of life with Bridget. I was reliving that part of my life the other day as I tried to write for the sake of posterity so that the children would someday know.</p>
<p>She said she wanted to have a normal conversation but that everything she said seemed to be the wrong thing. I was so sad because that was the same thing I wanted. Was it like what Bridget and I had when things were so broken? I can't remember.</p>
<p>I tried to share my pain and struggle with regard to: Winthrop, Rock Hill. She didn't know how to respond. She said that she had thought that when I returned the key to Peter that I would be telling him that I would not be teaching. I didn't know how to answer when she said that if I decided to teach that it was OK with her but that she was done. But then she imagined a situation where she would be involved with 1 hour of Jane's spring schedule. It seems clear to me that she doesn't really want me to teach, but she doesn't exactly say so.</p>
<p>I just hate the not talking. But one of my thoughts about the teaching was that I think we shouldn't be spending 24/7 together, that just the normal course of things we would get on one another's nerves.</p>
<p>Emptying my office yesterday felt genuine in the sense that without MP at Winthrop I didn't really have a place. My &quot;standing&quot; there was very minimalist -- a mere adjunct who was more disposable than the lowest rung of employee. The same applied to Winthrop. The feeling led me to thinking that I would relish moving. I would be glad to set out for Naples. But MP didn't know how to respond. I told her that I was making recommendations but just trying to share how I felt. Later she recalled that I had told her I didn't want to hear what she had to say. I couldn't remember the exact words, but I said that I never would tell her that I didn't want to hear. But I guess in the context when I said I wasn't talking about doing something -- to which she could respond, &quot;That's a good idea&quot; or &quot;That's a bad idea&quot; or &quot;I/We should do x, y, z&quot; -- but rather trying to share what's going on inside me.</p>
<p>She's really not very good at dealing with that.</p>
