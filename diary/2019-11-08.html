<p>Dreaming things seem so surreal. Julian ought to be here. Where's Julian. Mary Pat and I alone in the house. Where's Gini? No Katy. And the prospect raised late yesterday that Gini might be coming home today? It seems impossible.</p>
<p>May Pat understands that she may be offered the possibility of &quot;Redeeming the Time.&quot; (Mauritain) But she doesn't know if she has the strength or ability. The choices that Beth and (Annie and Frannie) have put before everyone seem out of touch, limiting, insufficient.</p>
<p>The &quot;H&quot; and &quot;K&quot; language is bizarre and not honest.</p>
<p>A part of my feels like I'm still in Florida.</p>

<p>At the hospital Franny seemed to have taken actions that were intended to sabotage or poke daggers into Mary Pat and me. A worker came trying to deliver food and Franny said that she had told them that we must have ordered food for the two of us, even though she knew that we had gone down to the cafeteria. Franny said to Mary Pat that she knew that they disagreed about the use of drugs but that if she, Franny, had been present when they asked about pain she would have said to avoid the Oxy-cocdene. It just seems like so much, []{#What the fuck.}<strong>What the fuck.</strong></p>
<p>I said to Mary Pat that I didn't trust a single thing that Franny said or does and that I figured it was mutual. And that I didn't care.</p>
<p>Remember, Dale, this is the most fraught time that I know of. It has been every time I've been around the death of a parent. I suppose murder or war is just as fraught. Remember, Dale, this is the most fraught time that I know of. It has been every time I've been around the death of a parent. I suppose murder or war is just as fraught. It's part of why I have tried to tell some of my family that the <span id="theft"></span><strong>theft</strong> of Lydia and Emma from my life is like a murder. It is a terrible awful thing that changes much. I acknowledge that Karla's mom's suicide is another such moment.</p>
