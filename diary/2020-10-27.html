<h1 id="my-world">My world</h1>
<p>After a night of sleeplessness, I’m left with the sensation that my world has been tossed out. That my deep unhappiness, disappointment, anchorlessness, depression? probably, has to do with my sense that everything I could count on has been lost.</p>
<ul>
<li>the terms of living together changed with Sean</li>
<li>new Supreme Court Justice who has virtually announced ahead of time that she intends to correct many of the things that have gone wrong over the last 50 years.</li>
<li>Sean is only 1 part of the huge items that are “off limits” in the marriage.</li>
<li>My discovery of this past month of counseling and direction is the recognition that it’s really about the relationship between Mary Pat and me that affects me the most</li>
<li>I hate living with another man in this household – I think if it was another woman it would be different. But it’s a man, it’s not a child. But in so many ways he’s just an adolescence.</li>
<li>The whole “mock handicapped” thing</li>
<li>Teaching is not what I experienced as a student or as a teacher over the last 50 years</li>
<li><p>the future of life on the planet is in question</p>
<h1 id="this-is-us">This is us</h1>
<p>Beth’s father said to her, “Our lives are built on the tragedies that define our lives.” What do you do with the terrible things? Make lemonade? As it was being spoken I made of it that it is the pillars of the major sadnesses of our lives that our decisions are fashioned into the future. Always we are defending the Maginot line. Two different takes.</p>
<p>Randall is dealing with “Black lives matter”. His siblings are too oblivious to really reckon with the reality. They are dealing with major events in their lives, as they seek some reconciling act: Kate getting a new baby from adoption, Kevin finding a spouse and a pregnancy with a boy and a girl.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As we watched it seemed unfortunate and somehow “telling” that Sean didn’t want anything to do with watching <em>This is us</em>. All the values important to us that he rejects. The focus is on himself.</p>
