<p>What kind of world do you want to live in? This isn’t a parlor game. It’s a moral query, maybe even an examination of conscience. We could certainly use a better world. One in which “Peace on earth” isn’t just a line in a Christmas card, and “justice for all” means everybody. A history cleansed of hostility would be ideal. Rewinding the climate crisis to subvert the damage would be optimal. But alas: only in a parlor game do we get to erase the past and rewrite the present.</p>
<p>The world is already broken. The cracks are obvious everywhere. If history can’t be rebooted and the present pretended away, only the future remains for our thoughtful, fateful consideration. So: how do you mend a broken world?</p>
<p>We might take a lesson from Kintsugi, the Japanese art of “golden joinery.” You’ve seen such bowls: chipped or shattered, then repaired with lacquer dusted with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. The sad broken thing becomes useful again, more lovely than before. The veins of precious metal don’t deny a fractured past. Rather, they absorb it, and celebrate transformation.</p>
<p>As an art form Kintsugi incorporates aspects of Japanese philosophy. It values the flawed, expresses regret for waste, and honors the reality of change. If the sacrament of reconciliation were a concrete object you could hold in your hand, it might look like Kintsugi. This could be a good Lenten reflection: to place a mended bit of crockery in the center of your daily meditation. Let it be a reminder of the sharp and splintered elements of your life that need attention. Because things do get broken: promises, relationships, hearts, people. Yet our trust is in the Lord who gathers up the fragments, that nothing may be wasted. What seems ruined or worthless now might yet be redeemed—if we just hand it over to the artist of divine repair.</p>
<p>Shattered objects can be bound together again using precious metals. What reconciles our interior brokenness is the precious element of forgiveness. Want a society of justice and peace? Begin with forgiveness. Hope to rid the planet of prejudice, greed, poverty? Fill the cracks of every intention and conversation with forgiveness. Need to find a way to live with yourself, after what you’ve done, or what you failed to do? Let holy forgiveness surround you like light and pour into your soul its grace.</p>
<p>If this seems too simple, remember how God selected forgiveness—not penance, not charity, not heroic deeds—as the vehicle of salvation. Recall how a man who couldn’t move from his mat garnered forgiveness from Jesus before all else. And how, from the cross, Jesus looked murder right in the face and chose to forgive. Our every Eucharist is a sacrament for the forgiveness of sin. “Do this in memory of me.” Do this.</p>
<p>Peter, wreathed in charitable feeling, once asked if seven episodes of forgiveness were plenty to cover his obligation. Such a constrained largess amuses Jesus, who recommends expanding that number to seventy-seven. The cracking sound that followed was Peter’s jaw hitting the ground—along with his sense of righteousness. Never fear: both can be mended. And when we consistently choose forgiveness as the restorative miracle that it is, even the saddest history can become, like the cross, desperately beautiful.</p>
