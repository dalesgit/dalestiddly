<h1 id="Examen">Examen</h1>
<ul>
<li>What surprised me yesterday? There was still so much resentment and hurt from MP re. the alienation from my kids. She takes it so personally herself. And it feels like a passive aggressive blaming me.</li>
<li>What inspired me yesterday? Finishing the sermon &amp; the poem.</li>
<li>What touched me yesterday? Learning that there are more resources for homeless in Rock Hill than I had imagined.</li>
<li>What did I enjoy doing yesterday? Editing (writing)</li>
<li>What would I like to more of?</li>
<li>What would I like to do less of?</li>
<li>What did I learn yesterday? Brief thought that some of the tension between us is that we are spending so much time together. A part of my intuition re. teaching is that it would get me out of the house.</li>
<li>What will I do differently today?</li>
</ul>
