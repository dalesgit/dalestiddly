<p>Yesterday I sent the texts to her and to the group explaining about the decisions with re. WELCM &amp; regular meetings. She responded with saying she was hurt and was cutting off the relationship with me.</p>

<p>Another email from Jennifer. What is it about it that makes me cautious? I think, I don't need this. I think the same thing about Sue's &quot;reactivity&quot;.</p>
<p>I am drawn into the spirit of Susan H's <em>Absolute Truths</em>.</p>
<p>I am mildly depressed on a chronic basis. Low energy. Wondering, &quot;What's the point.&quot; Mom's old question, &quot;Why am I getting up in the morning?&quot;</p>
<p>The political news is so depressing. I would love to move to Canada. MP will have nothing to do with that thought. She did allow us to think about spending 5 years living around Miriam's kids. I don't know. Phone call from Sean makes it seem like he might need us to be stable somewhere.</p>
