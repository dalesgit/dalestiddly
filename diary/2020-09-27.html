<h1 id="morning">Morning</h1>
<p>20201001220943 Sleep ok. Dreams don’t hang onto me like a grown up bully or a toddler weight. I’m aware of feeling disgust at the presence of Sean’s naked body slouched in my living room. I’m aware of judgment and projection with the awareness of his brooding smoking right outside my door. I’m reminded of Billy’s presence at mom’s house on Venus Dr. I rehearse the line, “I didn’t sign up for this. This is not how I want to live my last years.” But I then quickly respond to myself, “That’s the human condition. We don’t get what we expect or want. We end up walking on 3 legs and somebody else taking care of us.”</p>
<p>So I imagine my lot is to learn to put up with someone’s constant presence whom I don’t like or approve of. More than that I don’t trust him. I expect him to betray me. But that’s what I’ve got and will have.</p>
<p>The big looming test I put before MP – she couldn’t respond – was going to Dayton for funeral – or whatever. She’s looking to him having a license so he can drive himself to work. Even then, I told her, I don’t trust Sean living in this house by himself.</p>
<p>But it’s not my call.</p>
<p>I do think of going to Olympia – or at least the west coast – for a while. David company. Miriam and kids.</p>
<h1 id="whats-going-on-inside">What’s going on inside</h1>
<p>I think that for the most part I have deferred to MP on pretty much everything since we have been together, particularly since I left St. Mary’s. I was OK doing this for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had had control of finances for too much time, and I said and acknowledged that I didn’t do a great job of it</li>
<li>Variations of, “Yes, dear…”, were a part of my joy in saying and showing, “I love you.”</li>
<li>The move was prefaced with, “Whatever we do, I’m going where she’s going.”</li>
<li>I had already lost my children in Hawai’i.</li>
<li>n.b. that I gradually stopped climbing Koko Crater, and with the move lost my 2 counselors</li>
<li>Teaching in the Education Division at Chaminade was never a good fit for me – only so long as I was tangentially replacing Fr. Tim. After that I didn’t have any professional standing.</li>
<li>With Bob F’s imposed hiatus of “sacerdotal” ministry, there was a decisive break with the church that continued as I retired from the Pension Fund and made the geographic move</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>I once had a sponsor, someone who guided me through the 12 steps of a recovery program, who said his goal in life was to find such zenlike faith in God that he would be able to stare into a shitstorm with a smile on his face – an expression, I could tell by the tone in his voice, that he meant literally.</p>
