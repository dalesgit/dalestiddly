<p>Yesterday in the conversation that left me cold – when MP threw out the observation that other people who had come into my household I had welcomed “as if they were family,” and after recognizing that she didn’t want my input when someone was speaking ill of her or mistreating her, and after she identified the point at which there was a wedge growing between us as the time when I was shutdown in Dayton, first by Beth and then by MP for “defending” her – at that point I said to MP, &quot;Families are not <strong>binary</strong>.</p>
<p>After sleeping with that, I have grown more convinced that there is useful and important insight in that observation.</p>

<p>She has forced me to make the decision to cancel the nytimes subscription. It feels like a massive discount.</p>
<p>I feel pushed back into another issue between us. Long ago I expressed a desire – for me it feels like “pleaded” that we have separate “personal” accounts. She has not ever responded to that.</p>
<p>What she has done is tried to throw it back at me – the way Bridget did – “if you don’t like the way I do it then you do the finances.”</p>
