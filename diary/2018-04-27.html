<p>Message came from Bill around 1:25 our time. Timing sucks -- as usual. I feel a kind of deep peace. The thing I want to say is that she is finally released from her struggle.</p>
<p>I think of the things that need to be done now. But they'll come in their own time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I still go down next week?</li>
<li>Work with Jerry Lamb re. funeral</li>
<li>Call Russ Craig</li>
<li>Let people know at St.Â Paul's</li>
<li>funeral:
<ul>
<li>eucharist</li>
<li>make some simple music?</li>
<li>write a blessing?</li>
<li>Fr. Nick? Fr. Brian</li>
</ul></li>
<li>today's saint is Dorothy Soelle. &quot;combining the mystical and the political&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>He started off being angry that Mary Pat shared the info on Facebook. I think the anger came originally from David. That is then an ironic anger. I think, wtf, does our every decision need to be made through him? He was critical of my having made plane reservations without checking with him. I thought that's what I had done? I would have thought that 10 hours after death that getting the word out about death is appropriate. He reports that Shirley can't come on the 19th to a funeral because she has to house sit Logan's dog.</p>

<p>April is the cruelest month Karla's mom today discovered by Helen, 44 years ago 44 y/o 1974. Hale wont be here this coming weekend 6th.</p>

<p>He says about 30% of his work life is spent on his wills/bankruptcy enterprise. Michelle is helping, but she's still with the dentist. Madison got her scholarship. Excited about doing a combination of computer science and graphic design.</p>
<p>He will definitely be at funeral. Probably with family. Maybe Mo would want to come. Next week would be the best. Next best would be the 18-19th.</p>
