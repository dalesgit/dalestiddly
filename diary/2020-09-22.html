<h1 id="journaling">Journaling</h1>
<p>The story this morning referred to “getting up at 5am – (enormously early for that writer)”</p>
<p>I feel rested today. I said “no” to the tv and read until I fell asleep. Willa in the novel <em>Unsheltered</em> is living with at least a low-level depression. She’s had access to anti-depressants left over from the estate of her now deceased (suicide) daughter-out-law. I identified with that one.</p>
<p>Journaling may be the only thing I have left. Oh, and I have enjoyed playing piano the last couple of days. Writing and music. I’m not good at either one. But they do give me joy.</p>
<h1 id="use-prompts-in-joplin">Use prompts (in Joplin)</h1>
<p>I just saved a list of things to keep the brain active. It’s good. First thing is read “Brain Pickings”.</p>
<p>Prompt: In my house, what are the things that are the most me?</p>
<ul>
<li>The piano.</li>
<li>Some of the stuff in the kitchen, where I have tried to live with the spirit of Bro. Jimmy Dodds and my mother’s training as children and uncle John’s mantra, “If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all?” “Leaving things cleaner than you found it.”</li>
<li>my computer</li>
<li>my tools</li>
<li>my 2 plants</li>
<li>some of the wall hangings</li>
</ul>
<p>Sean coopted my shaving kit.</p>
