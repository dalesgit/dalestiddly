<p>Today we say goodbye to Mary Pat. She's a roller coaster of a time with her sisters this past week. They are uncomfortable with death and so speak in euphemisms and bawdlerized, Sunday School language with their mother. MP reports that Gini said to Katy, &quot;I'm dying. Will you help me?&quot; When Katy in a round about way said, &quot;No&quot;, Gini said, &quot;Where's Beth?&quot; I ache for Gini that they won't be open and honest with her. I ache for the family because they won't be open and honest with one another. I fear how things are going to go after she's gone.</p>
<p>We traveled to prehistoric times at the &quot;Fountain of Youth&quot; yesterday. Ate wonderful food at two restaurants. I had mahi mahi medallions encrusted in like a crab or seafood mixture, set on a sauce of mango and some other fruit. Served with a delicious corn medley, sweet enough, but with some interesting twists from peas and chiles.</p>
