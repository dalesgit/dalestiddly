<p>In today's morning prayer we read from a little bit of the prophet Hosea. It provided an image of God feeding his children. The first image that came to my mind was of the children I literally fed from the time of their infancy. You are one of those children. I am keenly aware of how at a certain point I stopped feeding you -- literally. I thought that it also could be construed figuratively. I stopped feeding you figuratively at some other time. I wondered, &quot;How might I feed you now?&quot; Honestly I have no ideas. But I'm sending you this little thought, and imagining myself saying, &quot;Hey! Hi!&quot; Not much, I know. But I do love you. Dad.</p>
