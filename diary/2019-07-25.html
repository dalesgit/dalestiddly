<h1 id="Prayer">Prayer</h1>
<p>What do I know about prayer? But I am preaching on it on Sunday. So humility is my background. I am just a beginner. Cf. Thomas Merton's prayer: I think I want what you want, Lord, but the opportunities of self-deception are everywhere and all the time.</p>

<p>Last night Bill asked me whether I remembered that Dad had got custody of David at some point. He gave me hints. And I seemed to recollect a change in circumstances when David left St.Â John's and returned to Denver. He had 2 years of football and success at a Lutheran High School. That was the time period and it led me to think about what was going on in my life then that I had so little recollection.</p>
<p>Of course to begin with I'm now almost 70 and it was a long time ago in human years. But, with some calculations, I would have been about 27 years old. I was in the process of entering postulancy and beginning to think about going to seminary.</p>
<h1 id="david-called-on-facetime-david-called-on-facetime">David called on Facetime {#David called on Facetime}</h1>
<p>I really liked again being able to see the Bill, Karla and David. I asked David if he ever had 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt; thoughts about not making a career of the Navy. He quickly responded that &quot;only all the time.&quot; But, he went on, he wouldn't have met T. It sounded so much like my reflections about Bridget. I so wish she had not been a part of my life. But without her Lydia and Emma would not have been, and even with the loss I feel with regard to each of them, I would trade the realities.</p>
