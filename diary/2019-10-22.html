<p>We are headed for Cape Canaveral today and tour of the Kennedy Space Center. It will be interesting. I connected with Liz and it seemed to be warm and friendly, but trying to talk about my theological and clerical relationship with Liz seemed to lead to all sorts of mis-communication with MP. Prior to going to dinner I was frustrated by a series of mis-communications that led me to feel like I was at fault for not being able to do this and that, and that if I had only done or known this when such and such happened. But I didn't know that I was supposed to respond in such and such a way.</p>
<p>I also touched base with Bill. He seemed genuinely touched that I was calling &quot;just to check up on him.&quot; He reported on softball dinner and his team made him feel so appreciated. His health is still a big issue, his foot and teeth. Karla has had some new issue arise.</p>
