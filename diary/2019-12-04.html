<p>Where oh where are we. MP reported that she spent most of her time at the doctor's office crying. They were profoundly concerned about her depression and sought to connect her with counselor -- at &quot;Saluda&quot;. MP asked me if I would go for marriage counseling there and I said yes.</p>
<p>It continues to be a mighty roller coaster and I don't know how to respond in part because she doesn't say directly what she means. I guess it goes with the territory. I should be better.</p>
<p>She said she's []{#so alone}<strong>so alone</strong> because she used to have the best partnership with me, but now she feels it slipping away. She regards my mood swings as a sign of behavior change that reminds her of what was reported about her dad prior to his first major heart attack.</p>
<p>She seems to regard a commitment to St. Paul's as still optional, or at least as &quot;my choice&quot; that somehow I could undo. I think she wants me to be unencumbered, no teaching, no commitment to churches.</p>
<p>Here I am, finally, talking about her -- just the way I did for so many years with Bridget. That's the awful part. And I don't know what to do about myself under those circumstances.</p>

<p>One of the intercessions had to do with &quot;preparing for the coming of Jesus.&quot; My insight was that &quot;the coming of Jesus&quot; ought not to be thought of in terms of the coming at Christmas or the coming in 2019 but rather as &quot;the 2nd coming&quot; of Jesus.</p>
<p>Mary Pat rightly observed that she thinks of it terms of the <span id="anamnesis"></span><strong>anamnesis</strong> of retelling the story, the experience of being present at the Eucharist or at Passover, the <span id="Hebrew"></span><strong>Hebrew</strong> understanding of time, indeed the &quot;<em>homo religiosus</em>&quot; of Eliade.</p>
<p>To this end cp. the <span id="amazing"></span><strong>amazing</strong> article on the BBC web site today: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191203-what-we-get-wrong-about-time">What we get wrong about time</a>.</p>

<p>He recommended two add-ons:</p>

<li>a boost for when the A/C compressor kicks in, extending its life and efficiency</li>
<li>an additive for the oil/lubricant intended to extend life of the lubricant</li>
