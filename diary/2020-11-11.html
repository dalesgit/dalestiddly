<h1 id="sean-the-decision">Sean the decision</h1>
<p>I woke reflecting on the “discernment” assignment from Linda. What decision? Does it have to do with boundaries and limits with Sean? As the weeks have rolled on with the “no talk zone” in place, I feel more and more a sense of <strong>resignation</strong> about Sean. I’m not happy about it but there’s nothing I can do about it kine.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m appalled that our lives are so much controlled by him and his tastes and schedule. If it weren’t for Sean we could have gone to Hilton Head, even if it meant going without children or guests. Mary Pat could have visited her mother and family.</li>
<li>What Mary Pat turns on the TV depends on whether Sean will be a part of it. He refuses to watch <em>This is us</em> which so invigorates us. “It’s not his thing.”</li>
</ul>
