<p>3 points for an assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to clarify the circumstances of the prayer we share.</li>
<li>Develop a conversation with her about what kind of problem solving we could work on as something less than the big one – Sean – to try to get confidence in the lesser problems.</li>
<li>Continue to “stay with her” as I did when we drove out to see the <strong>convergence</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>MP had made dinner and planned for the 3 of us to watch together. Sean got back from AA meeting and we sat down. She had asked Sean to make the rice. She regards it as his task now. She didn’t ask me if I wanted to watch the TV show (<em>Transplant</em>).</p>
<p>Sean finished, was doing the dishes. All I could do at the beginning of the meal was to sit and wait for it to be delivered. I sat and waited for Sean to take my dishes and continue putting them away. He was in the way; I would have had to make a move.</p>
<p>I thought about how she expects to have him do the chores. I had done them out of love. Where does that leave me?</p>
<p>She asks me, “Why are you mad?” How can I try to explain or has it out?</p>
<p>I so dislike sitting in the same room with him. I saw a big knife in his room when I took out the trash.</p>
