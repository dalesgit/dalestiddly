<p>Waking up dream. It had gone on and on. + Bob had invited me to supply at his church. As before. I knew that before I had been unable to find my way, I was late, I forgot cassock, etc. This time I was determined to succeed. It was a maze of buildings and rooms. Feeling a little like Lakewood Junior High when I got there. I made my way across the campus in plenty of time. But I couldn't tell what was where there had been so many changes. It was like a wholesale renovation had taken place, but the same structure was still present. Everywhere I saw signs of a radical change, a kind of coffee shop approach to the liturgy, but there was an outline of high church, Cathedral style worship. Lots of acolytes and vestments, but the procession didn't seem to go anywhere. We went through gathering areas, up and down staircases, I had finally found enough vestments to get vested, and was only a little bit late. But I lost the procession. No one was helping. Anywhere. I had forgotten my sermon. Then the pen I had with me, intending to take notes to preach from, sort of fell apart in my hands. It was a fountain pen. I had ink everywhere and on my hands.</p>
<p>I guess it feel like it must have been a metaphor for the way in which the world has passed me by. Now in higher education -- or pedagogy generally. Or is it the changed metaphors for learning, or an even deeper organic structural change in what human beings are in the current generation?</p>
<p>Peter is taking the online teaching certification that I am signed up for. It's not a model either of us is really interested in. But it's the world we find ourselves in.</p>
