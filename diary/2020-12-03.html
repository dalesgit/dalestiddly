<h1 id="dear-lydia-emma">Dear Lydia &amp; Emma,</h1>
<p>I woke up today with the notion to write this to you. I’m not sure why. And I’m not looking for a particular response. I guess it was a little bit, “This is something you should know.”</p>
<p>I am so glad to be alive. Neither of you knew my mother. Neither of you could have known my father who died in 1985. So neither of you could probably relate to the powerful sense of gladness I had when I passed the age at which my father died. That was 5 years ago.</p>
<p>I have his name. Many pictures of my father remind me of him. Each of his sons have his voice. Immediately after their divorce, my mother spent a lot of time being angry with me because I reminded her of him. Later I think she misplaced some of her appreciation for him, which she long repressed, onto me. Again, I served as a reminder to her of the importance he had had in her life, mostly, I guess in the form of 4 children.</p>
<p>I’m glad to be alive. There have been so many hurts along the way. So many disappointments. But there has also been ecstasy. Quiet sustaining satisfactions. Tears at the birth of a child. The deep calm I feel inside while sitting on a rock at the ocean’s shore. The sense that I have made a good facsimile of my heart’s calling from the age of 20 onward.</p>
<p>Two days ago I observed the anniversary of the death of one of my heroes, Blessed Charles de Foucauld, Desert Hermit (1858–1916). He died a terrible, violent death. The accomplishments of his life at the time looked like a profound failure and loss. Yet his impact on the spiritual life of the world has been almost beyond measure.</p>
<p>Yesterday there was a similar kind of anniversary. On Dec. 2, in 1980, very much in the midst of my lifetime and still vividly in my memory, four women were violently killed by representatives of a government that was supported by the US government. Three were nuns and the fourth was a devout woman who had felt called to serve the poor and indigenous population in El Salvador.</p>
<p>Inwardly, then as well as now, I call out, “Where is the justice, Lord?” But at the same time I feel as if the roots of my life have been nurtured by these martyrs. Dec. 1st was also the day the Episcopal Calendar has recognized Nicholas Ferrar. Perhaps you have read T.S. Eliot’s “Little Gidding.” Little Gidding was the village where Ferrar had moved his extended family in order to practice a kind of alternative monastic life, one intended for ordinary people, a place where “prayer would be valid.” The course of my adult life was shaped, in no small measure, by the powerful inspiration of Ferrar’s life and witness in England in the 1600’s.</p>
<p>After 2001, Pearl Harbor day, Dec. 7, took on a significance for me I never anticipated earlier in my life. I never wanted to go to Hawai’i until it finally landed at my feet. In very quick order I felt that I had arrived “home”, and in Hawai’i I experienced countless miracles and tangible encounters with the sacred, not the least of these was every time I visited the memorial to the Arizona. Arizona was where I was born, in a town that no longer exists. I’ve thought for a long time that it was a metaphor for my search for “home.”</p>
<p>Dec. 8 is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. I wasn’t raised Catholic, but through my 20’s, in a variety of ways, I felt called to the Catholic Church, through people like I’ve mentioned above, but also by a myriad of other inspirations. There was Thomas Merton via a man, who had been his colleague, and from whom I took a course in “Christian Mysticism” in the wilderness range of the Wyoming mountains. Major discernment took place there for me. My ex-wife, a friend, still works there in the summers, tending the horses. Another was Mother Teresa who I encountered through the writing of Malcolm Muggeridge – that one makes me laugh as I think of his autobiography which has in its title the word “curmudgeon”. It’s a reminder that there might be hope even for the likes of someone like me. At my better days I’m even a shade better than a curmudgeon, though not on my worst.</p>
<p>By the 1980’s I was ensconced in an Anglican version of catholicism, having been ordained on the Immaculate Conception in Milwaukee in 1982. I prayed the Hail Mary throughout the day and prayed it with my children every day, along with my own version of the Lord’s Prayer. I had to search to find an Anglican collect for the Immaculate Conception to use alongside the other prayers at my ordination. It was from the Scottish Prayer Book.</p>
<p>Dec. 9th was the day of the Honolulu Marathon in 2012. I know that because it was the day that Mary Pat and I chose to get married. We had planned to do it on the beach near the beginning of the marathon. We had to change plans. I know you have no way to have a good impression of that day for my sake, but you might be able to appreciate my saying that on that day I followed my heart in ways that I can’t verbalize but which have helped to knit my life together.</p>
<p>These days at the beginning of December are packed with memory and significance for me. I think on these things as I feel deep within me the gladness I started with at the beginning. I’m glad to be alive. I want that for you.</p>
<h1 id="discernment-re.-wu">Discernment re. WU</h1>
<p>I told MP about the inquiry from Peter and that I hadn’t anticipated having to decide so soon about teaching in the fall. I said something about being able to satisfy some needs of students and the department and she wanted to pursue it. She asked me if that was worth it for me? I felt like I wasn’t telling her these things in order to process them with her. I’ve lost confidence in being able to do that. I did it so that she would be informed when I did make a decision. I told her I would make it by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Tellingly, however, in response to her question about what was in it for me, I responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teaching has kept me these past few months from screaming and jumping off a cliff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The image I was working from was scene from <em>Thelma and Louise</em>, the car flying off the cliff at the US border with Mexico. I was being hyperbolic, of course, but to say that teaching has given me purpose and a reason to get up in the morning.</p>
<p>Listen, Dale, to what the Spirit is saying.</p>
