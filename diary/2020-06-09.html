<h1 id="Dream">Dream</h1>
<p>I wake this morning feeling the unfathomable wound, the jagged emptiness, caused by children ripped from my life. &quot;It's not about me&quot; they say. Emma, Bridget's evil culpability, my own powerlessness, these are the stuff of the dream I slept with in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>Miriam is doing such miraculous parenting and human coping with the cataclysm rocking the nation. Her post that MP shared with me from Facebook where she shared the amazing creativity and sensitivity she is giving her children, in her way trying to compensate for her own white privilege.</p>
<p>But in my aching insides I wonder how she can be complicit or unmoved by condoning the monstrous crime that Bridget perpetrated. Men, fathers, expendable. William Styron accused of monstrous racism after 1968.</p>
<p>Life can be so cruel.</p>
