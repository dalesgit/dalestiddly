<p>I slept well. I had taken Mucinex expectorant and it really seemed to believe that the thick mucus was better.</p>
<p>We had dinner with Sue Parker. Among other things she conveyed to me that I was her model for how to preach. I feel humbled. I don't really know why she feels that way -- obviously lots of other folks don't feel as strongly as she. But it made me think of the way I really poured my heart out for the folks at the Chapel on Sunday.</p>
<p>Today, perhaps we will find out a little more about Mary Pat's situation with Social Security. Perhaps not yet enough.</p>

But the music resources are kind of amazing.</p>
