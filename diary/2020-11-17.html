<h1 id="cant-sleep">Can’t sleep</h1>
<p>I am awake after ca. 5 hours of sleep. I went to bed upset at sitting next to him for a 1 hour episode of “Designated Survivor.” I just don’t like it. I don’t say that that’s ok. It is what it is.</p>
<p>And I recognize that Mary Pat thrives on meeting the desires and feelings of her son. That she relishes the chance to get to know him after the fractures of his adolescence.</p>
<p>What are the “principles” that get violated I spoke of at the counseling session?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sean doesn’t clean his own bathroom</li>
<li>Our lives are as much controlled by Sean and his desires, whims, and life-habits as we are by Covid-19. Examples include:
<ul>
<li>driving to and from work</li>
<li>$37 dollar carton of caffeine drink that I never would have purchased for any of my children.</li>
<li>we can’t go to Hilton Head</li>
<li>Mary Pat can’t go to her mother’s house</li>
<li>he gets to decide that his top priority is having a car – just like a 16 year old, spoiled with an expectation that he will be taken care of</li>
<li>our groceries are controlled by Sean’s desires, e.g. we have pork roast not Thai vegetables</li>
</ul></li>
<li>he is not being prepared for the costs of living on his own and in fact is incentived to stay with us as long as he can – it’s a cushy arrangement for him</li>
<li>he thinks it’s ok to lounge in front of us, flaunting his skull and cross bones tattoos</li>
<li>he does the minimum job of cleaning to get by</li>
<li>he is a guest for me – though I recognize he’s not for Mary Pat. He’s not family – how does that get recognized?</li>
<li>his natural instincts are southern, uneducated, white man.</li>
<li>cf. 11/17 above</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-do-i-enjoy-doing-why">What do I enjoy doing? Why?</h1>
<ul>
<li>writing: just what I’m doing here. But it’s all in the crafting of words that have some correspondence to inner realities. Cf. reflection above … I am not producing anything of particular significance – though sometimes it is. Cf. e.g. the letter to Emma. She seems to have disregarded it. I think it was a genuinely well-done piece.</li>
<li>sewing: it is crafting something useful from raw materials. Gives me satisfaction and sense of accomplishment.</li>
<li>walking: it energizes thinking, I’m learning as I go, I’m encountering another person’s inner life as I listen to lectures or podcasts</li>
<li>playing piano: there is some nostalgia. creating sounds of harmony and rhythm that are pleasing in some sense. I’m also exercising my hands.</li>
<li>solving puzzles or problems on the computer:</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="re-resentment-from-oct-9">Re resentment from Oct 9</h1>
<h2 id="insight-due-2020-10-09">Insight (due: 2020-10-09)</h2>
<p>It seems clear to me today, mid-day, that the real felt injury for me is that <strong>I have been shut out of decision-making with re. Sean</strong>.</p>
<p>I would also acknowledge that I share a part of the responsibility for that because I abdicated input, largely because I thought that the parent relationship trumped anything the step-parent thought.</p>
<p>In retrospect it seems that I experienced the primary relationship to be the marriage and that I needed to be more a part of deliberations.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think the pattern we had would allow – and it certainly doesn’t permit now – that I have anything to contribute. Mary Pat’s decisions are final.</p>
<p>There is a pattern of her responses to my thoughts is to explain why they are wrong. She doesn’t recognize that pattern.</p>
<p>All along these months, it seems to me, while she made final decisions, the question could have been asked, “How will Dale’s concerns be addressed?”</p>
<p>So the “forgiveness” is directed at Mary Pat.</p>
<h2 id="codependency">Codependency</h2>
<p>Sean is clearly dependent on us for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Shelter</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>Driving to and from work</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>Driving to and from AA meeting</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>Reminders, coaching, training … e.g. budgeting, spreadsheet use, banking His dependency and our willingness to provide controls our life by:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Where we live. Planning our lives. We had planned a move during this time.</li>
<li><ul>
<li>How long is he going to live with us?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>What we eat, when we eat,</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>What we watch on television</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>His binge eating, esp. sweets changes my occasional treats</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>His <strong>preference</strong> for certain foods, drinks: esp. consumption of soft drinks and power drinks that I have never purchased, for me or my children</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>Whether Mary Pat can visit Dayton</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>What books of mine have to be stored in storage</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-i-resent">What do I resent</h2>
<p>cf. above the ways in which Sean controls our lives</p>
<p>Mary Pat’s willingness to cater to Sean means that she doesn’t listen or pay attention to me</p>
<p>She expects even more that I cater to her demands?</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-have-control-over">What do I have control over</h2>
<p>what I communicate to Mary Pat</p>
<p>communicating my boundaries was well-received, even though there was no conversation with me</p>
<p>Whether I live in this space</p>
<p>Whether I participate in the “dependency” activity</p>
<p>Whether I support the “dependency” activity</p>
<p>When I wake up</p>
<p>Exercise, diet</p>
<p>Journal</p>
<p>Piano</p>
<p>Sewing?</p>
<h2 id="boundaries">Boundaries</h2>
<p>time for my priorities</p>
<h2 id="what-are-my-choices">What are my choices?</h2>
<p>My main “feeling” is one of powerlessness.</p>
<p>Knowing what I am in control of is difficult … thus “options”</p>
<h2 id="cost-benefits">Cost / Benefits</h2>
<p>Basic cost of living</p>
<ul>
<li>Sean’s disposable income: ca. $300 per week $1,260 per month</li>
<li><ul>
<li>mileage is 50¢ a mile: 26 mi per trip to work; 7 mi per AA (each times 2 for coming and going) … ca $35 per day. This is ca. 35x6x4.2=$882</li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li>room: rent ca. $1,000 per month My costs</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What’s at stake: “my place in the universe” My benefits</p></li>
<li><p>What’s at stake: “my place in the universe”</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="list-of-grievances-how-do-i-avoid-just-compiling-this-and-compounding-the-resentment">List of grievances – How do I avoid just compiling this and compounding the resentment?</h2>
<p>Sean doesn’t have skin in the game: he doesn’t need to take care of things, he doesn’t need to think of the worth of a thing, he doesn’t have to consider replacement value, …</p>
<p>He is effectively on vacation – but one of the impacts it has is that we can’t travel</p>
<p>He must get himself to and from work and meetings (most days?)</p>
