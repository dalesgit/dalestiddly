<h1 id="Dream">Dream</h1>
<p>I had four of my children with me, somehow two of them were close, the other two more distant. We were visiting in an unfamiliar town. there were mountains and pine forests. Something a little like Manitou Springs? I had traveled the territory via bicycle before. what was our destination? I'm not sure. We got sidetracked or lost and found ourselves in the driveway of an important person. I think it was the governor or maybe the mayor who was returning -- perhaps from Church services. Christmas?</p>
<p>I made a point of greeting them and saying I wanted them to meet my family. This was an attempt to defuse their anger at our having squatted in their driveway. At this point, though, there were 2 cars. I went to the first and didn't know who they were. The mayor assumed one was my mother, but I had to say I didn't know. But upon introducing themselves, it seemed that perhaps they were in-laws. Then we moved to our car. At this point my mother was in it, but I don't remember her being their before.</p>
<p>Everything was good.</p>
<p>Today Amy arrives and the over-full weekend begins with 2 concerts and then hooking up with Gary.</p>
