<h1 id="dream-about-lydia-dream-about-lydia">Dream about Lydia {#Dream about Lydia}</h1>
<p>It was totally about her although there were others in it. I was driving around Honolulu with Lydia &amp; Emma and someone else. Julian? Scott? Bill? Lydia was acting out in some way. Recalcitrant? Depressed? I was telling this other person that we had lived in Hawai'i for 3 years. Lydia wanted to argue with it. Then we were at an intersection. She jumped out and got into a little plastic car which a grown up clown was driving. They quickly drove off.</p>
<p>I was panicky. I parked the car as soon as I could. Then was arguing with police and someone else about where to leave the car. I tried to explain I had lost my daughter. They didn't really listen. I was distraught.</p>
<p>The clown made me think of Stephen King. The situation was just obviously malevolent. I got up.</p>
