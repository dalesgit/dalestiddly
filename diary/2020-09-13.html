<h1 id="such-familiar-shit">Such familiar shit!</h1>
<p>She won’t budget. I won’t budget. It feels like it’s coming to a head. What will happen? Explosion? She will win because she’s better at it, she’s a woman, I don’t fight back well. Whatever.</p>
<p>What I had wanted to write about since my session on Thursday was the word “longing.” What is my longing? What do I do about it? My longing right this minute is to be rid of this terrible conflict.</p>
<p>Is it a “lack of communication?” What is it that counselors can do? Facilitate that? Bring out compassion and empathy? I, at least, don’t have any good experience with <strong>couples counseling</strong>. I guess that’s important.</p>
<p>In quick succession she asks if she can come with me to my doctor’s appointment because she wants to ask what she can do to help with my pre-diabetic condition. And then she says in a happy go lucky voice to Sean that it sounds wonderful for him to cook breakfast. I said, “No thank you.” For diet reasons and for despair that it is not she and I cooking breakfast. It had become difficult already in recent months. There was a time when she said in anger that we should just eat separate breakfasts. It had become difficult to navigate with her spending large amounts of time on the toilet and trying to judge whether we waited for Sean to join us for prayer and my asking what she wanted, to which she regularly said, “I don’t care” leaving me perplexed as to what to fix.</p>
<p>Of course what Sean was cooking was bacon and eggs.</p>
<p>I left thinking I could sit in the living room while they ate or I could leave. I decide to leave. Only too late did I realize that I could have had cereal with them at the table. Or even cooked something myself.</p>
<p>Shrimp and grits would have been nice. But, of course, he doesn’t eat that.</p>
<p>My cereal is probably good for my health.</p>
<p>What the fuck! It just feels like no-win situations all around. Despair.</p>
<h1 id="how-can-i-help">How can I help?</h1>
<p>Oh, to hear the words of Dr. ?. If she were to ask that of me? And I of her?</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be important to be able to say, “I can do that,” as well as “I can’t do that.”</li>
<li>Forgive Sean. I can do that. Change how I feel? I can’t so easily do that. What would she say? And I?</li>
<li>Somehow the kitchen assignments made. I don’t want to be at the whim of whatever. Diet is important to me. My usefulness is built on the lines about ‘I do the dishes’ but now that’s gone. I ran the kitchen for all so many months – and now I am just shunted aside so Sean can feel useful.</li>
<li>Communicate with me. Listen to me. Respond with empathy rather than “No, …”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="temptation-to-fear">Temptation to FEAR</h1>
<p>:boundaries:</p>
<p>I have talked about boundaries for many months. I have never felt like she entered into the conversation. Acknowledged it. Perhaps she has and I just didn’t hear it.</p>
<p>I thought that I could deal with Sean living here. It now appears I can’t.</p>
<h1 id="longing">Longing</h1>
<p>:longing:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Call it sleep</em> (one of the best novels read)</li>
<li><em>World of our fathers</em> (evocative language)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>these put me in touch with a passion early on with identification with the “lower east side”. These emotions leave me inflexible with regard to Sean and various emotions expressed here. I said to MP, “I don’t give a flying fuck about sports” after a comment at the dinner table and Sean obviously in touch with the return of NFL and such not. This was in the context of whether the news would be on when she returned from taking him to an AA meeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that some of what Linda questioned me about had to do with the reminiscing, the remembering, of twilight of years. These are memories I don’t want to abandon, betray, – I want them remembered.</p>
<p>Seeing him prancing around her with his butt hanging out, now shirt and his skull tattoo blaring all day long – and I want to puke. I want to lash out some how.</p>
<p>There is a sense in which today I swear I don’t want compromises any more.</p>
<p>What is it I don’t trust about Sean. It’s that I don’t sense a shred of humility in him. It’s all in the pride of hubris, “I can do it.” # Generated Tags</p>
