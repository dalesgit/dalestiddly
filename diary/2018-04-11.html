<p>I awoke briefly while it was still dark. Then falling back into sleep I was startled, staying alert for a few minutes, by the vivid color of the dream. I was floating, like a drone, above a very green forest canopy. There were clouds lazily floating down among and around the trees.</p>
<p>I went on to dream about I think Hawai'i. At least the feel was like Hawai'i. There was a sense of security and love.</p>
<p>I have been taken aback a little by the extraordinary warm response I got from the people of Our Savior last Sunday. Word spread rapidly that I was the best supply they'd ever had -- and that sort of thing. Extending to Frank Pollano's mother -- then to Frank -- and to Jeannie Haubert in my office area. She confessed to me that they have worshipped at St. Peter's in uptown, but the distance has led them to start attending Our Savior. She said she wished that they had been there to hear me &quot;preach&quot;. She used language that didn't sound Episcopalian.</p>
<p>The build up of enthusiasm around the 2 of us at St. Paul's has been similar. It is true that it is now going to wane quickly as a new rector has been chosen, but I found myself thinking week by week, &quot;How can I match the enthusiasm that was generated last week?&quot; And I am not really reaching for the enthusiasm. It is more wanting to be genuine and competent. Both places appreciated my singing. One person at Our Savior was especially keen on the closing of my sermon. I have recently been more focused on the closing. But this person had some words, apparently commonly known, about what he thought should be there: <span id="question"></span><strong>question</strong> to go home with, a <span id="charge"></span><strong>charge</strong>.</p>
