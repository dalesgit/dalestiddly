<h1 id="reading-this-morning-what-matters">Reading this morning: what matters?</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/06/michael-steele-donald-trump-republican-party-interview">article on capitulation of GOP</a> &gt; Dr King said: ‘Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter.’</p>
<p>This quote is worth posting prominently in my daily life. What is what <strong>matters</strong> in my life?</p>
<p>An article about the deeply racist roots of Portland and Oregon. I tried contacting Emma with a question about Portland. She doesn’t respond.</p>
<p>Caused reflections with the broken relationships throughout the series we finished watching last night, <em>Thorn Birds</em>. Stanwyck’s wounded effort to inflict a curse on Ralph. Frank the love child, hidden from normal life, is doomed, never released from prison, mother never talking to him. Meggie’s husband utterly cast out of her life. 2 brothers bachelored to Drogheda for life.</p>
<p>And it made me think of my sister. I asked, “Do I want/need to contact her before I die?” Even Mary Pat conjectured about the fractured relationship between Shirley and Mom.</p>
<p>“On Labor Day, remember this: Trump’s America works only for the rich”, by Robert Reich. At least some, if not a good bit, of this article expresses what matters to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>abandonment of workers</li>
<li>our racist past</li>
<li>selfish aggrandizement</li>
<li>concentration of wealth, victory of monopolists, Microsoft etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Keep it simple stupid”</p>
<h1 id="spiritual-direction-notes-prelim">Spiritual Direction notes prelim</h1>
<p>They used to have a satellite office at Oratory. Bro. Joe is on the board.</p>
<p>Possible matches that came to mind as I talked to her:</p>
<ul>
<li>Al Sproul. Lives in Shelby NC but comes to Charlotte regularly for appointments. He is a contemplative and retired.</li>
<li>Ann Chamberlain lived at one time in Hawai’i. retired UCC minister but is doing direction and ?supply? in Virginia.</li>
<li>Linda: a Catholic contemplative, focuses on Ignatian spirituality which she repeated several times means “finding the sacred in the everyday”. She also has an older interest in Enneagram.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to try that match.</p>
