<h1 id="after-the-bad-guys">After the bad guys</h1>
<p>In my dreams it seemed that I was in a non-customary role. I was trying to catch the bad guys. Like in Anne of Greengables (with an “e”). In the last dream it came down to a transistor radio like device. I had figured out how to change the battery or some such, but I wasn’t sure it was going to work. We tried.</p>
<p>But somehow the bad guys were cons. Our effort was trying to defeat the cons that they were imposing.</p>
<p>I’ve let the violets dry up. Blooming is coming to an end. I wonder how long they’re supposed to have flowers. The purple ones have been with us for several weeks, maybe 3.</p>
<p>Sean got a pin for 30 days sobriety. And he got a ride home from AA last night. I wasn’t enthusiastic but said, “That’s good.” It made me think that MP is mostly interested in getting the burden of driving him everywhere lifted. She had been looking at motels near his work for in case we had to quickly go to Dayton.</p>
<p>No expense for her boy. I think regularly in the kitchen about how she made it clear in a variety of ways that she wanted me to do things just so. There was a right way to fill the dishwasher. There was a compulsion about keeping certain things clean, everything had to go into the dishwasher. Don’t rinse the dishes before putting them in. Light switches. Locked doors.</p>
<p>But for her boy she’s totally flexible.</p>
<h1 id="lectio">Lectio</h1>
<p>servants, harvest time, vineyard,</p>
<p>Cf. that we saw on TV the vineyard of Sonoma burning up, “harvest time?”</p>
<p>God’s hand is in what we don’t expect: servants didn’t get what they expected, stone that was rejected is now the most important.</p>
<p>What you perpetrate will be turned back on you (Courtney)</p>
<p>Jamison hears “mercy” but “you can’t pull wool over his eyes”</p>
<p>Expectations of those who think that it’s all about “me”, but (great reversal)</p>
