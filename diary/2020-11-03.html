<h1 id="watching-election-returns">Watching election returns</h1>
<p>I can’t watch. Tue Nov 03, 2020 11:03 PM. CNN is laboriously following the same pattern as in 2016.</p>
<p>Blessed text exchange with Lydia, recalling her jubilation at the election of Obama in 2008. She has an ugly premonition of doom for this election.</p>
<p>I said I share it, while still hoping. By tomorrow will the hope be gone? They’ve been saying for days that it may be days and weeks before we know. But a Biden victory might be predictable if enough states flip. That doesn’t seem to be happening right now.</p>
<p>I told Lydia that I had thought about moving to <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Canada</strong>, or <strong>Portugal</strong> if Trump wins. I still may decide enough is enough. Where do I want to live out my days? I think it’s possible I will decide not here.</p>
<p>A place where a huge swath of the population:</p>
<ul>
<li>thinks it’s OK to bully</li>
<li>thinks that thumbing our nose at the rest of the world is a good thing for the US</li>
<li>that psychologically flawed human being is suitable to lead us (ala Nero?)</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>And on it goes. It would, it would seem, be without Mary Pat. So that’s a big decision. But a lot is riding on the joint counseling session next week.</p>
<p>I didn’t like sitting in the living room with Sean preparing for his driver’s license exam which apparently he is going to take tomorrow morning. I wasn’t informed about it, of course.</p>
