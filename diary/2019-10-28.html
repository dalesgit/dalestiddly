<p>Yesterday we drove to Anastasia State Park. Julian and I rode bicycles for 2 hours while Mary Pat napped and scouted restaurants. She picked one out that we had dinner at, sitting outside and watching the sun go down over the inland waterway. Seafood platter, shecrab soup, low country boil. Wonderful dinner.</p>
<p>At the park Julian and I rode around every little trail, walked out to the water, across the dunes, and saw the site of the quarry from which the &quot;coquina stone&quot; was dug by prisoner, Native American, and slave labor to build the fort that we're planning to see today.</p>
