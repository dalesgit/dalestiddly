<h1 id="singing-a-morning-hymn">Singing a morning hymn</h1>
<p>The sappy lyrics associated with the morning prayer in <em>Give us this day</em> prompted me to want to write a response.</p>
<p>Morning is a quiet easy rising from slumber. Night feels these days like a battle to get in enough hours of sleep. I got up once for an hour to write about what was racing through my mind. Each time the pain in my bladder gets strong enough, I head into the toilet to try to empty it. Often it’s a struggle. Never is it easy.</p>
<p>The dreams are rarely gentle, although not always a struggle. Children stolen from my life figure often. Trying to get to where I’m going is a long-standing theme. Accomplish what I have purposed to do – is it someone else’s agenda? For many years I was conscious of pursuing the projection of my father’s wishes for me. Being a “doctor”. Now? It’s not even the time of life to be pursuing dreams, but, as the director ? said, waking to read the obituaries to see if I’ve died.</p>
<p>With Sean in the household it doesn’t feel like life restored but no more life to live.</p>
<p>So waking in the morning is like, “Well, I guess I’m alive another day. Go make some coffee.”</p>
<p>Where would be my joy? How do I sing a prayer or lead-in to prayer. Recognize the demons? I told Courtney at the prayer group yesterday that the way she draped the cloth around her, trying to keep warm in her dorm, she looked like a rabbi in a prayer shawl <em>(tallit)</em>. I feel more like a Jew, rising from the 20th c., staring down the understandable obscenity of Benjamin Netanyahu’s land of Israel, shaking my fist at God for his often God forsaken promise to choose me for him/herself.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, we rise from slumber, but only to wonder at a world that seems all too ready to swallow up humanity in a hurry for all the <em>hubris</em> we’ve thrown up in our million year (or so) human experiment. Sort of like the several centuries old American experiment that seems set to come to an end.</p>
<p>We sing, God, but it’s a somber song.</p>

<p>Write Forest, write. Some satisfaction in getting Kmymoney set up on office machine + Dropbox. Getting close to balancing with MP’s spreadsheet – which really only tracks the checkbook.</p>
<p>Similar kind of satisfaction at how smoothly I was able to grade the RELG 101 discussion threads.</p>
<p>I surprised myself at feeling hurt when Courtney conveyed that she was taking Peter’s Old Testament class. I’m glad for her. I’m glad for Peter. But that was my class for a few years.</p>
