<h1 id="Depression">Depression</h1>
<p>There's a lethargy about my spirit that feels persistent. It's not debilitating but always just around the corner. Where is the future to fight for? What am I getting up for in the morning? I feel so much like I'm walking in mother's shoes, her last 10 years or so.</p>
<p>What to do about it? Certainly activate the silver sneakers benefit I have. One value of the YMCA is that it would be indoors, out of the oppressive weather.</p>
<h1 id="bill-miriam-bill-miriam">Bill &amp; Miriam {#Bill &amp; Miriam}</h1>
<p>In the phone call of two days ago <a href="2019-07-24.html">2019-07-24</a> Bill reported that Miriam had contacted him after a long period of silence. She apologized and then asked him for an estimate of how much they might expect from the sale of the house. Her urgency she explained with an account of how 2 doors down from them a former inmate had moved in. His crime had been drug (heroin) addiction.</p>
<p>My intuition about Miriam's silence toward Bill as well as possibly me is that she has had a growing sense of []{#existential fear}<strong>existential fear</strong>. Is it a result of inner changes going on inside her? Is it responses to growing alienation from Lee? Fear of what is happening in the country? I don't know.</p>
