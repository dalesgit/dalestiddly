<p>[]{#The Experience of Resurrection}<strong>The Experience of Resurrection</strong></p>
<p>We often read or hear homilies that make it seem as if the Gospel stories are historical occurrences from the life of Jesus and his disciples. They well could be, but the goal of the Gospel writers was never straight history. In fact, the genre of historical literature as we know it today didn’t exist in the ancient world. The Gospels were written decades after the resurrection, and the authors aimed for a truth way beyond historical facts. Their true goal was theological—to say something definitive about God—rather than historical. These authors utilized great literary license in how they presented their stories about Jesus. We read the Gospels better if we are attuned to their theological and literary characteristics, rather than reading them as straight history.</p>
<p>In the Lectionary this week, we hear varying accounts of the resurrection. In John 20, Mary Magdalene sees the empty tomb and weeps, thinking Jesus’ body had been stolen. When he stands before her, she mistakes him for the gardener. The disciples on the road to Emmaus in Luke 24 walk with the resurrected Jesus, “but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him” until the breaking of the bread. In John 21, the disciples did not know that it was Jesus preparing a shore lunch. These stories portray characters who can’t see the resurrected Jesus, even when he’s right in front of them. They are shocked, dense, or unprepared.</p>
<p>If we ask literary and/or theological questions of these stories of resurrection, we might ask something like: Why would the authors present the Gospels’ main characters as unable to recognize or believe in the resurrection? What might the authors’ theological or literary agendas be? What are they trying to say? (Note how very different this is than just asking, “What happened?”)</p>
<p>One answer to our questions could be that these authors understood the difficulty of the resurrection. The idea of a resurrection of the dead, or even of an afterlife, was something of a controversy in the first century. Most Jewish people likely did not believe in resurrection or afterlife. The afterlife was also not a major driver of piety for most people from a polytheistic background within Greco-Roman religion. So, in a general sense, many people may not have been primed for believing in someone being bodily resurrected from the dead.</p>
<p>Another way of answering our questions is to suggest that the evangelists believed the resurrection is more than just a one-time historical occurrence. Resurrection is a deep pattern of God’s activity. Jesus’ bodily resurrection is like a down payment (the “first fruits,” to use Paul’s language in 1 Cor 15:20) of what the experience of resurrection will be for everyone.</p>
<p>All these Gospel characters have an encounter with the risen Jesus. It is never what they expected, and it’s not on their own terms. The authors are suggesting that we ought not look at the resurrection as just a one-time occurrence in the past but as an ongoing reality mediated through sacrament and encounter. We can cultivate our belief in the resurrection and its implications by participating in the sacraments and by seeking out encounter with others. The resurrection is not just a historical event, but a theological truth—it tells us something about God. The resurrection is all around us, and this week’s Gospels can help open our eyes to its reality. —<em>Micah Kiel</em></p>
