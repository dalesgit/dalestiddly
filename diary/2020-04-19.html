<h1 id="Today">Today</h1>
<ul>
<li>read and graded the available Tent discussions</li>
<li>tabulated and did first read-through grading of Sunflower papers</li>
<li>collected questions for the final review sheet</li>
<li>washed the porch table with Mary Pat -- first time we've even approached a yard/garden project</li>
<li>Listened to lecture on <span id="Theodicy"></span><strong>Theodicy</strong> in Great lectures. It is helpful in expanding my vocabulary re. the &quot;problem&quot; which isn't a problem. He identifies 5 responses:
<ol type="1">
<li>There is no omnipotent, all-just being</li>
<li>Dualism</li>
<li>If this is not the end, then it can all be worked out in the end.</li>
<li>reincarnation is a species of #2.</li>
<li>??</li>
</ol></li>
<li>He presents the overview of the problem:
<ul>
<li>trilemma: all-powerful; all-benevolent; innocent suffer</li>
<li>failure to take the reality of our experience seriously, preferring dogmas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>His interpretation of Job is wholistic and not historico-critical based. The prologue establishes that Hasatan is a functional officer, like CIA. 3 friends go on and on as if to illustrate that their dogmatic sermons are empty. Job maintains that they deny his experience. Epilogue: God provides the ultimate <span id="experience"></span><strong>experience</strong> -- a theophany -- and Job is made little in its place. The closing, however, where Job receives everything back in spades, is a reversal. It goes back to support the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; of the 3 friends. As if to maintain that there is no answer to <span id="theodicy"></span><strong>theodicy</strong>. Everytime you think there's an answer it will be overthrown.</li>
