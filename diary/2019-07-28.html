<p>Sleeping there was so much tossing and turning. After I poured myself out at St. Mark's for the 4 folks gathered, I'm somehow apprehensive about 2 services at Our Savior.</p>
<p>Some satisfaction that as we watched TV I fairly straight forwardly downloaded the correct CHromeOS and got the old Acer working again, losing, of course, all the tweaks I had accumulated over 10 days or so.</p>
<p>I found myself this morning unable to just quickly open the lid and begin typing in Vim in my diary/journal. I really like being able to do that.</p>
<p>At St. Marks: David &amp; Elizabeth, Elaine &amp; Kevin. I asked Kevin why he wanted to be confirmed. He showed signs of feeling interrogated, which I assume has always been an uncomfortable event for him. I tried to make the best of it, giving him language like, &quot;I sense that you feel like you are accepted as a part of a family?&quot; Then I added, &quot;I hope I can be here for your confirmation.&quot;</p>
<p>Mystery person is who is the pastor person who is speaking during the weekday events and &quot;inviting people to join the church.&quot; An evangelical who is attracted himself to the BCP and other things?</p>
