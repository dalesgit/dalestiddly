<h3 id="double-bind-catch-22">Double-bind, Catch 22</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mary Pat has a history with Sean that is complicated and not really openly resolved with him or within her</li>
<li>step-parenting is a complicated negotiation in any case</li>
<li>I have for too long buried my own convictions</li>
<li>If my greatest sense of injury is that I have not been made a part of the decisions about Sean, the only way to have remedied that was through negotiation. We don’t have a good history of <strong>negotiation</strong>.</li>
<li>A statement this is what I would like – then leave it to Mary Pat respond or not.</li>
<li>I have felt like pressuring Mary Pat was a betrayal of her rights and needs as a parent trying to “re-do” past mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="insight-due-2020-10-09">Insight (due: 2020-10-09)</h3>
<p>It seems clear to me today, mid-day, that the real felt injury for me is that <strong>I have been shut out of decision-making with re. Sean</strong>.</p>
<p>I would also acknowledge that I share a part of the responsibility for that because I abdicated input, largely because I thought that the parent relationship trumped anything the step-parent thought.</p>
<p>In retrospect it seems that I experienced the primary relationship to be the marriage and that I needed to be more a part of deliberations.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think the pattern we had would allow – and it certainly doesn’t permit now – that I have anything to contribute. Mary Pat’s decisions are final.</p>
<p>There is a pattern of her responses to my thoughts is to explain why they are wrong. She doesn’t recognize that pattern.</p>
<p>All along these months, it seems to me, while she made final decisions, the question could have been asked, “How will Dale’s concerns be addressed?”</p>
<p>So the “forgiveness” is directed at Mary Pat.</p>
<h3 id="codependency">Codependency</h3>
<p>Sean is clearly dependent on us for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Shelter</li>
<li>Driving to and from work</li>
<li>Driving to and from AA meeting</li>
<li>Reminders, coaching, training … e.g. budgeting, spreadsheet use, banking</li>
</ul>
<p>His dependency and our willingness to provide controls our life by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where we live. Planning our lives. We had planned a move during this time.</li>
<li>How long is he going to live with us?</li>
<li>What we eat, when we eat,</li>
<li>What we watch on television</li>
<li>His binge eating, esp. sweets changes my occasional treats</li>
<li>His <strong>preference</strong> for certain foods, drinks: esp. consumption of soft drinks and power drinks that I have never purchased, for me or my children</li>
<li>Whether Mary Pat can visit Dayton</li>
<li>What books of mine have to be stored in storage</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-do-i-resent">What do I resent</h3>
<p>cf. above the ways in which Sean controls our lives</p>
<p>Mary Pat’s willingness to cater to Sean means that she doesn’t listen or pay attention to me</p>
<p>She expects even more that I cater to her demands?</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-have-control-over">What do I have control over</h3>
<p>what I communicate to Mary Pat</p>
<p>communicating my boundaries was well-received, even though there was no conversation with me</p>
<p>Whether I live in this space</p>
<p>Whether I participate in the “dependency” activity</p>
<p>Whether I support the “dependency” activity</p>
<p>When I wake up</p>
<p>Exercise, diet</p>
<p>Journal</p>
<p>Piano</p>
<p>Sewing?</p>
<h3 id="boundaries">Boundaries</h3>
<p>time for my priorities</p>
<h3 id="what-are-my-choices">What are my choices?</h3>
<p>My main “feeling” is one of powerlessness.</p>
<p>Knowing what I am in control of is difficult … thus “options”</p>
<h3 id="cost-benefits">Cost / Benefits</h3>
<p>Basic cost of living</p>
<ul>
<li>Sean’s disposable income: ca. $300 per week $1,260 per month</li>
<li>mileage is 50¢ a mile: 26 mi per trip to work; 7 mi per AA (each times 2 for coming and going) … ca $35 per day. This is ca. 35x6x4.2=$882</li>
<li>room: rent ca. $1,000 per month</li>
</ul>
<p>My costs</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s at stake: “my place in the universe”</li>
</ul>
<p>My benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s at stake: “my place in the universe”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="list-of-grievances-how-do-i-avoid-just-compiling-this-and-compounding-the-resentment">List of grievances – How do I avoid just compiling this and compounding the resentment?</h3>
<p>Sean doesn’t have skin in the game: he doesn’t need to take care of things, he doesn’t need to think of the worth of a thing, he doesn’t have to consider replacement value, …</p>
<p>He is effectively on vacation – but one of the impacts it has is that we can’t travel</p>
<p>He must get himself to and from work and meetings (most days?)</p>
