<p>Fear of dying? I think not as much as I am afraid of losing the cutting edge of self-reflection. That's the importance of this little piece.</p>
<p>I wondered if I should move back to using a physical book and a pen. It's slower but has a long history.</p>
<p>Fatty liver disease. I don't really know what it means. I know that quitting drinking alcohol is an obvious step that should be taken. &quot;What makes life worth living?&quot;</p>
<p>Thinking about the Jeff Bezos piece about doing away with presentations in <span id="meetings."></span><strong>meetings.</strong> Instead reading a short essay and then framing a discussion around guided questions. I have had classes like that -- and I think some of the best.</p>
<p>Size of the class will determine whether I can manage class discussions or they have to be smaller groups.</p>
<p>I miss Lydia and Emma. Such rich memories -- built pretty deeply on love. And just thrown away.</p>
<p>And Bridget? To have no relationship? I wish only to have something for the sake of the children. But there is nothing. I guess that was the failure of all those years of &quot;doing it for the children.&quot;</p>
<p>The profound cynicism and violence of the Trump years really weighs on me. Britain is going through the last throws of the ending of their glory. Greece was once a glorious place and passed on a glorious heritage. Now it is struggles to avoid being a failed state and for many centuries wasn't even that.Now it's Britain's turn to fade into the background. Trump has ushered in the era for the US. Putin is reigning through the glory-years of the Soviet experiment. China even newer at playing master of the universe (earth).</p>
<p>You can do so much more when you play the []{#long game}<strong>long game</strong>. Palestinians. Chinese. So why not Africans? Indigenous peoples? Women? Homosexuals? Let them rise up.</p>
<p>Do I hear a melody? Is it some kind of wisdom?</p>
