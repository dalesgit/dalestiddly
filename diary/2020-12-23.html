<h1 id="waking-dream">Waking dream</h1>
<p>Sean had done some kind of wacky manic thing like he has done in the past. I can’t remember what it was. Now I do. He had boxed up a bunch of our books (More than we have at home right now) and put them into huge boxes that were placed into the entrance way of our house. I remember some philosophy books in the bunch, books I haven’t had since the 80’s.</p>
<p>Like the painting of the apartment 18 years ago, actions that I have only known through MP stories, it was a mess that would take a lot of work and energy to clean up. Most of all it was an indication to me that, “OK, Sean’s in a manic phase now.”</p>
<p>Does the dream indicate my own sense of having lost myself and seeking to find it again? “Finding my place in the cosmos” I had said to Linda. It’s a huge metaphorical task. The couple’s person – Janet – doesn’t deal with subtlety, but I was determined to get something positive out of the interview, I was determined not to be identified as the “loser”, and I think she was plodding but determined to get a “task” for me/us to be working on and that the task would be built from things I had identified or said.</p>
<p>Talk about boundaries. Maybe I can’t sit in the living room with him for long periods of time. Dinner is problematic. Perhaps a boundary is that I need to step up and determine my own diet. A la Olga-Maria and Amy with their eating issues.</p>
