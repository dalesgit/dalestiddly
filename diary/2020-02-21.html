<p>Fri Feb 21, 2020 03:40 PM</p>
<p>The other day I listened to my first session with &quot;Poetry Unbound&quot; from []{#On Being}<strong>On Being</strong>. The poet Pádraig Ó Tuama from Ireland. One comment on the blog said that it was so wonderful to hear his voice that he would be pleased to hear him read from the phone book. I get that.</p>
<p>The poem I heard him speak to is: “Substance Abuse Trial” by Jane Mead</p>
<p>He mispronounces you, the judge, rhyming your first with your second name, making you into something ridiculous: Gillis Willis Mead.</p>
<p>But you stand as still as they taught you in the army when you were a young man trying hard to keep secret what you knew about how to kill with germs. As quietly as we used to stand on the front porch together at dusk listening for the first cricket of the evening.</p>
<p>Now you stand accused of wanting to die, of saying so endlessly, with needles—and the speechless track marks recording it all.</p>
<p>The evidence is a red river, mounting. It wants to carry you away like an old chair some fisherman forgot to take home. And I want to shout: listen</p>
<p>—this man is my father. I love him.</p>
<p>Is there a place where all those things that catch in the throat gather and shape themselves into something as soft as the G in Giles was meant to be pronounced?</p>
<p>Is that where you thought you were going?</p>
