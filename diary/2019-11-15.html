<p>Beth reported to Mary Pat that while MP had asked if she could help []{#I had not.}<strong>I had not.</strong> I blurted out, &quot;Fuck you, Beth.&quot; It almost shut down conversation between MP and me. It led me to try to share with MP my need for some relief. It's not ok to share my feelings of frustration and anger. I have had no space in this visit with her family which has been exceedingly unrewarding, challenging, objectionable.</p>
<p>Three times I have blurted out my anger. Once Beth reported that she didn't want to happen with her family what happened in my family. Another was when Katie insisted that in spite of what has happened they love me. Again, today, it happened when Beth reported that I had not asked to help.</p>
<p>I think that Beth and I had 3 conversations. On 2 of those occasions she said, &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>The projections that have been foisted on me are so objectionable.</p>

<li>I don't want explanations or justifications (will I listen if they require it? []{#What I would like is to be heard}<strong>What I would like is to be heard</strong>.</li>
<li>Before I received news that Beth was glad I wasn't here, I had thought of this family as more my family than my own. I now feel unwanted and mostly unwelcome.</li>
<li>I have watched this family betray with treachery the woman that I love and my primary reason for being here. The secondary reason is that I have come to love your mother. But I am a very minor figure in her universe.</li>
<li>3 times (above) I have heard as much as I could hold within</li>
<li>I have experienced this family now as a group of vipers</li>
<li>I am put in a lose/lose catch 22 with the following:
<ul>
<li>My reason for being here requires of me that I love you</li>
<li>The family here does not want me here nor appreciates what I have to offer</li>
<li>Everyone would be better off if I weren't here with the exception of Mary Pat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are other people -- not here -- who would appreciate my presence and what I have to offer, but I can't be with them.</li>
<li>When I respond to you with appropriate courtesy, which I can do, you should know the above is true.</li>
<li>Life doesn't give us []{#do overs}<strong>do overs</strong> (SK)</li>
