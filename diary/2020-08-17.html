<h2 id="corinthians-1013">1 Corinthians 10:13</h2>
<p>ESV</p>
<p>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</p>
<p>CEV</p>
<p>You are tempted in the same way that everyone else is tempted. But God can be trusted not to let you be tempted too much, and he will show you how to escape from your temptations.</p>
</body>
