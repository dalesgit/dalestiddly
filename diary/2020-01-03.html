<p>Yesterday dinner with Sue and a game of the new train game. I won. Sue seemed to like it.</p>
<p>I was curious to see where she seems to shut down. Politics is one. And when I shared the account of our meeting and dinner with Yahya &amp; Majeda was another. Maybe it was just outside her experience? She shared that she is going with the Our Saviour group to Ecuador in the spring. But since she's been there before she's going to stay longer -- to try to []{#do something}<strong>do something</strong> she said, not just visit.</p>
