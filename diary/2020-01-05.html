<p>By 4 am I couldn't sleep. My mind was racing. Why? I focused on how often there was a Christmas 2 in our calendar. I had said something about it to Susan at dinner last night at Barb's.</p>
<p>The answer is that whenever Christmas falls on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday there will not be a Christmas 2.</p>
<p>I also thought some about the rubrics for my upcoming class. Changes need to be in []{#Discussion threads}<strong>Discussion threads</strong> and []{#group writing}<strong>group writing</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Discussion: combine my previous written questions into one complex prompt. 200 words minimum. Respond to 2 peers with: compare and contrast your own thread. Grade based on: (cf.Â my previous rubric + 20% on the response to peers)</li>
<li>Group writing: previous prompt + a shorter evaluation based on the group's drafts. 20% response is grade.</li>
</ol>
