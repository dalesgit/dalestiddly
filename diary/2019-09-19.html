<p>Sitting at Waffle House, I told Mary Pat that I was &quot;toying&quot; with the idea of teaching <span id="if"></span><strong>if</strong> Peter was willing to go along with my putting 25% of the course online. We had made a &quot;deal&quot; to go there and then to Publix to do big-time grocery shopping -- Wednesday being []{#senior day}<strong>senior day</strong> and all. MP seemed agreeable to my idea. The online part was to give us some flexibility for when we might want to &quot;get away&quot;, but thinking that we didn't have any long trips planned.</p>

<p>I had the most satisfaction from getting the reveal.js plugins to more or less work, the audio recording to &quot;more or less&quot; work. My computer work is a &quot;problem-solving&quot; exercise that doesn't have human interaction in it.</p>
<p>As I watched the movie last night, &quot;The Deerhunter&quot;, much of the time was spent with a &quot;blank&quot; face, similar to what MP describes with AJ when he was riding the roller coasters at Disney world.</p>
