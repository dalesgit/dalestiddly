<p>So is this what it comes down to? She escalated an altercation in the kitchen to “I’m done.” With intention to leave. I felt like I was done with having that being her bargaining chip or whatever it is/was. I decided it was time to call her bluff that that was a move that is not constructive.</p>
<p>I asked her about plans for dinner. She left it to me to prepare supper. We’d had a nice time watching a Romance novel inspired TV show. When she came out as I was mid-way through putting the food on the table, she quickly became enraged. “Why won’t you talk to me?” To which I tried to explain what I was doing but she would have none of it.</p>
<p>I continued heating mine and ate it. She retreated to the bedroom. Probably to plot her next move. I reflected that it had been just less than a week before the last time she tried to blast her way to I don’t know what – walking out onto US 5.</p>
<p>She emerged fromt he bedroom armed with her argument about why I was the problem. I forcefully responded when she said, “You won’t talk to me.” I told her that she was not the “queen bee.” That she was not the master to me as a slave. I may have called her a “bitch” – she later quoted that – but she was being that when I seemingly couldn’t do anything right without her bitching about it, which is probably the way I used the word.</p>
<p>So, then, for her that was it. She’s driven off now. Mon Dec 28, 2020 07:09 PM.</p>
<p>Lydia’s birthday. I don’t know what’s next. Probably not good. I don’t know what’s to become of Sean.</p>
<h1 id="the-terms-of-reconciliation">The terms of reconciliation</h1>
<p>If the terms are that it’s ok for her to yell at me when I don’t do what she wants me to do but I am not allowed to be angry, or even frustrated – because she has a “problem with anger” – then it’s not okay.</p>
