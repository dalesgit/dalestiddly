<p>Saturday. Each day this week has had one thing to mark it on the calendar. Today it's Peter and Christina's party. We both felt so honored to have been invited. But going to a party with 20 something people, most of whom I won't know, in the 100+ heat of these days does not sound inviting. But it will be OK.</p>
<p>Dreaming at the end of sleep was comforting somehow, though I don't remember it.</p>
<p>Difficult decision to reach and facing a challenging conversation with MP. But I must establish an &quot;allowance&quot; for myself. Yesterday she asked about my purchase with AmEx for ca. $12.00. I explained it was my replacement for the &quot;fruit basket&quot; that had been broken from our wedding day. I didn't know who gave it to us. She knew that it had been Joan &amp; Joe Silverschlag -- so it was not very precious in her eyes. She rolled her eyes as if to say, &quot;What a wasteful purchase.&quot;</p>
<p>For my own well-being I must have some money, however small, that is mine to spend. The easiest I think would be to use my green AmEx card and it would be paid off each month with a check. But we'll see what she thinks.</p>
<p>The amazing good news she got from Social Security yesterday is that her penalty will be just $90 per month for the WEP issue. But she will get a check of some $8-9 thousand going back to November as spousal benefit. (She could have been claiming ever since I took my SS, but she overlooked a letter.)</p>
