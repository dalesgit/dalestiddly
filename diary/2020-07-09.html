<p>Working to feel comfortable with the MacBook in the workroom. Gives me two screens. Today I got the resolution issue worked out. And I'm working with my old keyboard. Seems helpful.</p>

<p>Mary Pat imagined Jesus &quot;spreading the seed&quot; via Zoom if he were here.</p>
<p>I'm really distracted.</p>
<p>Olga-Maria talked about the conflicting opinions she is hearing with the colleagues she is consulting with. In particular about how to respond to Covid-19. MP makes of it that it is not the disciples' (our) responsibility to know how people are hearing the word, but to be extravagant in speaking it.</p>

<p>She sent me an email. Haven't had time to share with MP because of lectio.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I saw you have my email and that’s okay. Reaching out to let you know that I’m getting married. My partner’s name is Dmitriy and he is so special to me. He was born in Russia and grew up in Portland.</p>
<p>This past year I’ve been working as a student teacher and finishing a masters program. I passed all of my exams and waiting for my Special Education license. In the Fall I will have 6 boys!</p>
<p>I’m really happy. I struggle at times but who doesn’t. Dmitriy and I started reading together in our evenings. A few years back Mama gifted Lydia and me a collection of The Teenie Weenie stories so we may start reading those.</p>
<p>It’s been many years since I’ve shared with you about my life and I’m not opening a door for regular conversation but this is what I want to share with you today. Uncle David sort of encouraged me.</p>
<p>Mama has had breast cancer twice. It’s been really hard for her. She’s going to retire before her next birthday and move to Indiana. My heart aches for her to find peace and joy. She’s on her way.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself, Emma</p>
<h2 id="to-emma-to-emma">To Emma {#To Emma}</h2>
<p>It is obviously a huge, major, epic, big deal that you have reached out after so many years. There is so much to share, all around. Congratulations on your plans to marry. I gather that that's the news that occasions your email.</p>
<p>I'm curious about what exactly the &quot;collection of Teenie Weenie stories&quot; is? I gave the collection that I had received from my grandmother to Miriam. My request to Miriam was that she (Miriam) take care of them, and I had given her addresses of several museums that I thought would be interested in them.</p>
<p>It turns out that reading to one another is something that Mary Pat and I have done for many years now. We started when we moved to the mainland and had occasion to take long trips by automobile. We passed the time by reading huge books; several Michener books, and quite a variety of mostly novels. One non-fiction was partly about one of my childhood heroes, Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>For a number of years I have been taking several pretty powerful drugs for atrial fibrillation and recently had cataract surgery. So I don't see terribly well, my heart has major problems, and I have trouble hearing. I've retired from the church but work pretty hard serving churches. I've retired from teaching at the university, but am working pretty hard at trying to put together online courses for this fall. We've had my mother's ashes on our mantle for several years now. The idea had been that some group of interested people would gather at Myrtle Beach to spread her ashes where George's had been spread. An abundance of extraneous things have intruded to delay those plans. There sits my mother, a daily reminder for me, and on occasion I think I want to pick up the phone to talk to her.</p>
<p>I don't have a clue what is the right thing to say to you.</p>
<p>But the beauty is not the madness Tho’ my errors and wrecks lie about me. And I am not a demigod, I cannot make it cohere. If love be not in the house there is nothing. (<em>Canto 116</em>, []{#Ezra Pound}<strong>Ezra Pound</strong>)</p>
<p>Love, Dad</p>
