<h1 id="everyone-was-there-everyone-was-there">Everyone was there {#Everyone was there}</h1>
<p>Dream this morn where all my everyone seemed to be present. Even Shirley. We were going to an event of some kind. Waiting for everyone to there before we headed out. Bill was one of the leaders, but not the only one. Karla, Julian, there were handicapped (or recovering people) -- was it Mary Pat? Going to a church, sort of. Also like going to a sports event, with concourses etc.</p>
<p>The thing that stands out is that I wasn't being hindered from getting where we needed to go. I woke in the midst of heading up one of the concourses, sort of herding all the people.</p>
<h1 id="mary-pat-mary-pat">Mary Pat {#Mary Pat}</h1>
<p>Mary Pat and I slept in separate beds, she remained in the guest bedroom. But we ate my supper, though separately because she said it was &quot;so cold&quot; in the living room. Weird. But we embraced in the kitchen and expressed our love. It was almost even erotic for me. But so, so welcome. Then she went her separate way.</p>
<h1 id="tweak-to-trackpad-tweak-to-trackpad">Tweak to trackpad {#Tweak to trackpad}</h1>
<p>followed the instructions at <a href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/FAQ/Touchpad" class="uri">https://wiki.galliumos.org/FAQ/Touchpad</a>. Will it help? Not tweaked are acceleration of mouse. My file setting is <code>sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf</code>. If I have to adjust the acceleration, I need to make that permanent with a line in <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>For the moment, however, it seems to be working better.</p>
<h1 id="Linux-MX">Linux-MX</h1>
<p>Spent lots of time yesterday burning then testing and adjusting the LiveCD of Linux-MX. I like it in a lot of ways. A kind refined version of antiX.</p>
<ul>
<li>The machine in office maxes out cpu to 100% on firefox. Only marginally better with chromium. I have installed Pale Moon that seems to use less. Will it work for me? &quot;Min&quot; might also work but it's not in the available repositories.</li>
<li>I don't need LibreOffice. Is that part of why the &quot;root&quot; is so large. It has to fit in memory.</li>
<li>Root persistence is a pain, but the setting in Conky allows me to see it clearly grow.</li>
<li>remastering brought it back to zero. It took about an hour on the Toshiba laptop. It didn't look like it was every going to complete on the Aspire in office.</li>
<li>Both Toshiba and Aspire have Atom processors clocked at 1.6 ghz. The Aspire has 2 meg memory, Toshiba only 1. But something is marginally faster in the Toshiba. Perhaps &quot;bus speed&quot;?</li>
<li>It is too cumbersome, however, to try to run the Toshiba with the large monitor.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Are you going to Prayer Group this evening?
</dd>
<dt>MP</dt>
<dd>I don't have a drivers license so I can't go anywhere.
</dd>
<dt>DH</dt>
<dd>(Somewhat bewildered) I meant to find out whether you wanted to go.
</dd>
<dt>MP</dt>
<dd>You didn't ask that.
</dd>
<dt>DH</dt>
<dd>(Exasperated, after a pause, trying to think what to say or do) Do you want me to drive you to prayer group.
</dd>
<dt>MP</dt>
<dd>We can't talk civilly to one another. That's why I'm living in the bedroom.
</dd>
<dt>DH</dt>
<dd>[I was frustrated, exasperated, was there anger too? Perhaps a little because I felt like I was being jerked around by her. I tried to say in plain language, I purposely used a quiet voice, that I was trying to say in precise language what I wanted. I said that it seemed as if I hadn't used the corrected words or tone or phrase and so I didn't get a response.]
