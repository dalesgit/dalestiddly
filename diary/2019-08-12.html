<h2 id="Email">Email</h2>
<p>I cleared out the gmail and outlook accounts. I utilized shortcuts in gmail:</p>
<ul>
<li>mark the mail I don't want to delete</li>
<li>change it to read</li>
<li>mark all unread mail</li>
<li>delete it</li>
</ul>
<p>Winthrop mail I utilized Exchange so that I could sort by sender and dispose of or refile.</p>
<h2 id="notice-to-peter-re.-teaching-notice-to-peter-re.-teaching">Notice to Peter re. teaching {#Notice to Peter re. teaching}</h2>
<p>I sent him notice re. not teaching online. I then asked him if it would be all right for me to remove my things from the office this week. I didn't tell him I wouldn't teach, but I'm inclined that way.</p>
<p>Clearly he wasn't thinking that I would have a presence in the floor. I think he ok'd my email but didn't imagine that I would have a kind of pseudo place on the faculty.</p>
<p>Possibly others objected or he realized the &quot;key mafioso&quot; would have a very dim view of my having a key.</p>
<h2 id="moms-estate-moms-estate">Mom's estate {#Momâ€™s estate}</h2>
<p>Per MP's suggestion, I think I'm settled to accept my &quot;payment for my co-trustee&quot; status. To the tune of ca. $17,000 I will distribute it to my 5 grandchildren.</p>
