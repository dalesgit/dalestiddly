<li>Choose one of 2 moral / ethical issues in our contemporary society: 1) the availability of legal and safe abortion or 2) capital punishment. Explain the difference between <strong>deontological</strong> justification of moral issues and <strong>teleological</strong> justification. Then give a justification for and against the ethical issue of your choice, using both <strong>deontological</strong> and <strong>teleological</strong> arguments.</li>
<li>Describe the 5 pillars of Islam. Briefly explain how each pillar exemplifies one of the aspects of religion that you have learned this semester.</li>
<li>Outline the life of Abraham as told in the Hebrew Scriptures. Describe at least 2 ways in which the Islamic stories and legends of Abraham differ from that in the Hebrew Scriptures.</li>
<li>Using examples from the drama <strong>G-d on Trial</strong>, discuss how bringing the <strong>beit din</strong> against G-d made a kind of sense to the prisoners in the light of G-d’s <strong>covenant</strong> with Israel, his Torah which for 3,500 years breathed life into Judaism, and the threat to the survival of the people. Offer an explanation for why the prisoners prayed to G-d after finding him guilty.</li>
<li>“I asked myself if it was only the Nazis who had persecuted us. Was it not just as wicked for people to look on quietly and without protest at human beings enduring such shocking humiliation?” (p. 57). Some of the commentators believe that those who were following orders were just as guilty as those who gave them; others, like Dith Pran, draw a moral line between followers and leaders. Would you hold them equally responsible? Why?</li>
<li>“Without forgetting there can be no forgiving,” says retired Israeli Supreme Court Justice Moshe Bejski (p. 116); the Dalai Lama, on the other hand, believes that one must forgive but not necessarily forget. Do you think it is possible to forgive and not forget? How would you differentiate forgiveness and reconciliation?</li>
<li>We have identified 4 basic responses that religions have made to our experience of suffering and evil. Describe and briefly explain, with illustrations, the 4 basic responses.</li>
<li>How can ritual go wrong? What happens when it goes right?</li>
<li>What would human life be like without the idea of sacred reality?</li>
<li>How does mythology aid humanity in understanding their own lives?</li>
