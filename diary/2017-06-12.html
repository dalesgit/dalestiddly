<p>We made a trip mostly on blue highways, leaving the interstate after about 50 miles. We traveled through Apache country toward Globe -- the launching place for the highway to Ray, Kearny &amp; Hayden. Beyond that we went through the &quot;Tonto National Forest&quot;, Roosevelt Reservoir, and lots of siguaros. It was a beautiful ride, above the heat and oppressive atmosphere of the valley from Tucson to Phoenix.</p>
<p>Mary Pat is getting better.</p>
