<p>Splendid evening I think. Gary was the entertainer, jokes at hand, etc. And Peter &amp; Christina sharing culture. Christina was sitting next to him &amp; parried with him. Sue reported that she had received a phone call from Columbia expressing concern about her preaching/teaching at St.Â Mark's. They were ok with her being the Treasurer for them.</p>

<p>Peter asked if I wanted to come back in the spring. He said of my evals that the students liked me, they appreciated my passion. He shares my concern that he doesn't identify with the generation and increasingly so.</p>
<p>The thing that makes it most possible is that Will is willing to let me teach the 101 section he is signed up for now. THat would be the easiest. He also thought that I might be able to get certified by the BlackBoard people if I showed them my experience.</p>
<p>I could gather quite a lot, I think, from my records with 600, computer practice in Chuuk, ??</p>
<h1 id="Dream">Dream</h1>
<p>Kind of strange motif that repeated over several wakings at the end of my sleep. I was invited to examine at some level a couple's child, a daughter, who was only several inches high. Was she healthy? Seemingly. She disappeared into the apartment and play area. I ended up concluding that my recommendation was that they get a cage for her -- for her own safety.</p>
