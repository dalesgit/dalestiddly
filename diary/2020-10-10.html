<h2 id="emma-in-dreaming">Emma in dreaming</h2>
<p>For some extended time, Emma and I were the main figures in my dreaming. It was maybe a little bit like the gamesmanship going on with Sean. We were in relationship but she understood her role to be to do combat with me.</p>
<p>Clearly one of the emotional things going on for me with Sean here is a kind of jealousy. Maybe I should just call it that. I laugh, because it’s not the old romantic, sexual jealousy, but a deeper more classical <strong>envy</strong>. #discernment ## working on breakthrough?</p>
<p>2 distinct experiences this evening combine for a visceral kick to the stomach. First, acknowledging that with Hawai’i gathering in convention “virtually”, I could, in fact attend. But reading various links to acquaint myself, seeing David Jackson as returning to Hawai’i and serving in Kapa’a cf. <a href="http://www.allsaintskauai.org/blogs--epistles/welcome-rev-david-jackson-kahu-kawika">call of David J</a> he is running for Standing Committee. He evidently came on at the same time I was going off. His “platform” is building up the focus on indigenous “host” culture. Recognizing that I am no longer connected with these bits. A different generation? What would it be like to attending the convention?</p>
<p>Then, also, reading a little bit of Louise Gluck, I realized it might be possible to pursue the anger I feel about losing my place in the universe. Dylan Thomas. Read <em>Alverno</em> to get in touch.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Approach resentment as the addictive state of mind it is.</li>
<li>Realize that you are using resentment to replicate old dramas and acknowledge that you cannot change the past.</li>
<li>Examine how your resentment may come from mentally confusing people in your present life with people from your past.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that you cannot control those who have rejected you.</li>
<li>Recognize that your resentment gives you only illusions of strength. Instead, highlight and validate your real strength and power.</li>
<li>Learn to identify signals that provoke resentment. Apply the acronym HALT, widely used in 12-step programs: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, and Tired.</li>
<li>Practice cognitive behavioral techniques to stop indulging in resentment. Put a thought between your feelings of resentment and indulging in ruminating about them.</li>
<li>Acknowledge your part in allowing the abuse to occur, forgive yourself for that, and make a decision to not let it occur again.</li>
<li>Declare an amnesty with the person you resent and with yourself.</li>
<li>Forgive when you can, and practice willful and deliberate forgetfulness when you cannot, keeping in mind that these acts are gifts to yourself rather than capitulation to the people you resent.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy people, those who feel joy in their lives and assume the responsibility for their own happiness, remain neutral about events that would cause others to spiral down in despair. Life happens. Good events, as well as shockingly bad events, are part of life. When a series of challenges occur, these happy people consider them to be just another drama in paradise! How we choose to react determines if we are a victim or a victor. If I can take charge without complaining and whining and snivelling, then I win. But if I take charge by judging others, being hurt or angry, or holding on to resentment and self-righteousness and then seeking revenge, they win. They win because I’m carrying them on my back!</p>
