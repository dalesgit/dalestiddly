<ul>
<li>Got some clarification about starting certification #2. Not as much as I would have liked, but …</li>
<li>Worked on outlining the whole course, spreading out the assessments, looking for balance … All with the goal of completing Module 4 and proceeding to signing off.</li>
<li>Frustrated that I haven't had any feedback.</li>
<li>Enormously intimidated by one of the participants in #2 -- a &quot;decorated author&quot; etc.</li>
<li>But I think, actually, it's all about getting them to approve my course towards the beginning of the semester.</li>
<li>No walk! Boo.</li>
</ul>
