<p>The passage I focused on was &quot;the people who sat in darkness saw a great light.&quot; It meant for me that the gospel message (through Isaiah 9?) was aimed at a people, not individuals.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a &quot;people seeing in dark&quot;? And what is it about the calling of 1st disciples in Matthew 4 that is corporate rather than individual?</p>
<p>The world around Andrew/Peter and James/John was about to descend into chaos and ruin. But Jesus offered them light, hope, life. &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life.&quot;</p>
<p>I am utterly unconvinced that it was the Protestant message that Jesus was bringing. Much closer for me is the message that in spite of all evidence to the contrary, evidence of ruin and betrayal and collapse, nevertheless there is what I offer.</p>
<p>So they walked through the door into lives that they knew not what, lives that for most was doomed, but they are still with us to this day. What they grasped when they responded to his voice was a way that lives.</p>
<p>For the truth of it looks more like <span id="dharma"></span><strong>dharma</strong> than it does anything particularly Christian. The <span id="shalom"></span><strong>shalom</strong> looks more like the &quot;4-fold&quot; truths of Buddhism. Oh my.</p>
