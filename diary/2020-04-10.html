<p>The reader of Isaiah totally reminded me of David Jocelyn. He was the only one dressed just in a cassock. He was obviously a trusted reader for the cathedral. His intonation and phrasing, his earnestness, and his evident kindness all seemed like David.</p>
<p>He took the part of Jesus in the Passion, just as David so often did.</p>
<p>The Dean's voice and cadence, even appearance, reminds me of Frank Gray. At a time that Frank seemed less poisonous to me.</p>
