<h1 id="return-home-return-home">Return home {#Return home}</h1>
<p>Glad to get <span id="home"></span><strong>home</strong>, and MP made some fun of me for being surprised by finally calling it <span id="home"></span><strong>home</strong>. I disavowed it -- but it was in contrast to my discomfort at being at the Sjostrom home. Then I felt even less engagement with Joe -- as if he was distracted. Tami spent 2 days being sick -- it brought them back from their 38th anniversary celebration.</p>
<p>I feel a little bit panicked about getting my course done. And sensing that I have got very little feedback from this 2nd instructor.</p>
