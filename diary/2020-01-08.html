<p>I am waking early. 6 - 6:30. Today I woke up knowing I would be able to read the computer screen.</p>
<p>We watched the &quot;Jeopardy&quot; &quot;Tournament of Champions&quot;. James got beat pretty soundly by Ken. I just hate watching him lose. I'd rather not watch, but MP wants to.</p>
<p>I figured out how to control .spacemacs re. e.g.Â org-publishing. I think it's working but in the Linux / Pcloud configuration it's finicky.</p>

<p>The reveal component is working.</p>
<p>I tried to make sense out of the configuration / workflow that I have for my web site.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>working files for planning</li>
<li>org-staging for getting presentations in order</li>
<li>publishing</li>
<li>github folder</li>
</ol>
<p>I did a good bit of brainstorming for sermon on Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="tasks-to-do-tasks-to-do">Tasks to do {#Tasks to do}</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>post discussion thread for week 1</li>
<li>develop presentation for Monday</li>
<li>finish syllabus</li>
<li>write 1st draft of sermon</li>
</ol>
