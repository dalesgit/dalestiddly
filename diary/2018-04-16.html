<h1 id="dream-last-week-of-class-dream-last-week-of-class">Dream: last week of class {#Dream: last week of class}</h1>
<p>Through several cycles of waking before getting out of bed. Even going to pee once. There were dreams that had familiar themes going on and a familiar face. The face was Betty Spillman. The setting was some kind of conference or training camp. We were housed in a maze like giant institution that I have identified in the past as Notre Dame. I was trying to be with Betty, but was stymied at every turn. Where was Mary Pat? The whole thing seemed more like a symbolic fable than a reality based story.</p>
<h2 id="our-savior-connection-our-savior-connection">Our Savior connection {#Our Savior connection}</h2>
<p>A couple was in attendance at the Sunday last at Our Savior. They were moved by my words and have asked me to marry them. Mary Pat knows the woman whom she had as a student. We had her several times as a server at the Burger Pub in Baxter.</p>
<h2 id="talk-with-bill-talk-with-bill">Talk with Bill {#Talk with Bill}</h2>
<p>He called because he had been depressed. Phone call with Glick this morning led to him deciding to put Mom back in the hospital. Her kidneys and liver are not functioning properly. We both talked about organs shutting down. But Glick said to him that he was going to recommend that we &quot;try one more time&quot; to get Mom out of what has dragged her down.</p>
<p>I don't really think that Mom would have made the decision Bill did, but I whole-heartedly support Bill in making the decision. I told him that Glick is the one medical professional I would trust to have Mom's best interests in mind. I told Bill that Glick can make the call for hospice, he did it with George. Bill agreed.</p>
<p>Bill put the issue for him as, &quot;I don't know where I should be.&quot; I contrasted that with having things to <span id="do"></span><strong>do</strong>. I asked if he would feel bad if he's in Flagstaff when she died. He said not any worse than being in Las Cruces. He understands that Karla is a strength and support for him. I recognizes that he is sick and needs to get well.</p>
<p>Mary Pat and I see the possibility of needing to be in Las Cruces after finals are over. It seems that it won't be that long. I said to her that it wasn't that I don't have any desire to be with Mom. It is that I would gladly choose, if I could, to be with Mom when she dies. I recognize it as an event that is intensely intimate and blessed. But I recognize that all too often we don't get to choose who will be with someone when they die. Charlene has a better chance. But there's no guarantee there.</p>
<p>Shalom, Mom. Blessings. Mercy. And laugh along the way.</p>
