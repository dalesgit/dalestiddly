<p>Julian is here. He started growing his hair about the same time I did. About as long, only, of course, his is all brown. There are so many things about his life style that remind me of me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark or others put him onto magazine <em>Make</em>. For DYI folks. Expensive. Step by step in doing things. Amazing.</li>
<li>his determination to &quot;do it himself.&quot; Building a shed in a couple of weeks so that he doesn't have to pay rent on a storage place to hold all his tools and equipment.</li>
<li>Going his own way, maverick</li>
<li>music, figuring out how to make the computer work for him</li>
</ul>
