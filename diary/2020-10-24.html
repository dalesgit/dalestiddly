<h1 id="slept-peaceful-last-night">Slept peaceful last night</h1>
<p>Somehow there was little turning and thrashing. I only had to get up once to pee. The dreams were like the plodding progress I made yesterday in preparing quiz questions for RELG 317. Not particularly exciting, but getting there.</p>
<p>Today I anticipate being present with members of the diocese of Hawai’i in convention. It doesn’t seem bitter, with regrets. Yesterday I had a conversation with Cindy from St. Peter’s. I will have to make some decisions about the format and presentation of Christmas at their church. They haven’t had a service since the pandemic began in Feb-Mar. The last thing I remember stirring in my brain before I decided to get up was the Christmas playlist I prepared for the trolley at St. Mary’s. A mixture of things. Sort of sing-a-long, but not necessarily. Enjoy the lights and the ride – and the company.</p>
<ul>
<li>Country western (Dolly Parton just came out with album)</li>
<li>Old classics</li>
<li>The Lesson’s and Carols, King’s College, choir from England</li>
</ul>
<p>I wondered about bringing my amplifier. I thought about the mixer, the microphones setup. Why would that be a peaceful sleep?</p>
<h1 id="hawaii-convention">Hawai’i Convention</h1>
<p>I was startled by +Bob’s message to convention. The theme was really anchored by an opening (I guess intended to be a <em>hook</em>) that he has experienced the pandemic restrictions in a basically positive way. It seemed to me that he was saying that his introverted tendencies were “stroked” by the restrictions. He had time to spend with “his clergy” in their weekly bible study. (He no doubt exercised his no it all manners.) He regretted that he hadn’t been able to hold his granddaughter (too young) and he hadn’t seen his grandson in a year. I thought, well many of the folk will have known the son as he grew up in Hawai’i. He had had time to read and study, to exercise his introvert ways.</p>
<p>But in its strange sort of way, the message sounded like a version of Trump. Tone deaf to where the people are. Focused on himself – that’s an old pattern I was aware of from a long time ago.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Then the responses came. All of them folks new to the diocese since I left. Mostly younger folks. The only outlier seemed to be the new priest at Epiphany. He spouted a southern accent and he had what to me was old tired sounding evangelical messages, doubling down, if we just do it harder, with greater intensity.</p></li>
<li><p>But mostly the people who spoke in response to the bishop’s address presented a <strong>vision</strong>! I thought again and again, I could follow them.</p></li>
<li><p>the young newly ordained woman who is at St. John the Baptist in Waianae. JR had been there for a time.</p></li>
<li><p>The young woman in charge of the formation education track – name?</p></li>
<li><p>The leader of the group – I’ve seen his name but I can’t remember it. He spoke with passion and leadership, vision, such that I could say, “Yes, I’ll go with you for a ways.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They all seemed to be in contrast to Bob’s lack-luster presentation. The big deal seemed to be that a team was going to go out to the congregations asking for a mission statement so that the diocese can know how to support them in the new frontier that is emerging, “It’s a new world we’re moving into.” Deck chairs on the Titanic in spades was how it sounded to me.sq</p>
<p>I ended up feeling like I was at least a generation away from all those folks. Thinking, “Bob was right to want to get rid of me. I was too old.” But I know that I wouldn’t want to go back. I’ve faced some of those things here in the Carolinas. And I’m tired of it.</p>
<p>I’m persuaded by the lectures I’ve been listening to these weeks about the Reformation, that the Anglican reformation was in fact a “Protestant” reformation. It had the trappings of Catholicism, but was at its root protestant. I understand it today to be essentially mis-guided.</p>
<p>Not that the Catholic church is any clearer, Pope Francis’ affirmation of civil unions for LGBTQ folks not withstanding.</p>
<p>If I were a teenager today, I would never in a million years set out to be an Episcopal priest. Or even an Episcopalian.</p>
<p>What does that make me? I guess I’ve become quite jaded in the past 10 years. Or is it just the last 6 since leaving Hawai’i? I’m not sure.</p>
