<p>MP returned home. I tried to keep the power balance. Good for the goose good for the gander. She tried maintaining “I” language. We both slip into “you …” Her boundary: “I will not stay in the same room that I am being called names, etc.” My boundary: “It’s not ok with me when the escalation happens to e.g. ‘The marriage is over.’ Or ‘This is it.’” That’s the key that set me off to not back down last night.</p>
