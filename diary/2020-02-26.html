<p>Wed Feb 26, 2020 02:10 PM call to her. I opened with slight reference to cruise, then reporting about Mary Pat's affection and our deep appreciation of the writing that she did. She became weepy quickly. Then I asked her to tell me about the death and then about the kids reaction.</p>
<p>It was about 2 weeks of decline that seemed to just be old age. She had been on steroids for many years. Her bones seemed to be giving way. She showed lots of signs of being in lots of pain. A vet with assistant came to the house and allowed all of them to be with Kuma as she died.</p>
<p>The cruise is out of Palermo, then Barcelona, Marseilles, Genoa, Rome -- where she and Mo will stay instead of returning to Palermo. Miriam remembered that Mo and her mother had traveled together in the twilight of her life. They will be flying out of Denver on Mo's 70th birthday.</p>
<p>Mo's original intention had been to have an artist's retreat because she has been doing a lot of watercolor recently. She's teaching a course in it. Miriam described it as a particularly creative phase in her life right now.</p>
<p>I told her about the money for the kids. She reported that they have been working with a financial advisor who is doing a &quot;makeover&quot; with them for the year. She thinks the money will go into a college fund but will work out the details with the advisor and get back to me.</p>

<p>Today (Ash Wednesday) she was more sick, not even getting out of bed. I'm concerned about her flight on Friday.</p>

<p>Discussion re. finalizing schedule for S-21. I will have 317 at 5:00 pm. There is a person taking his 316 who works full time in Health Center and she's a good student. He's going to incorporate what I did the last time for a final where there were groups reporting on the 5 areas of concentration. I don't remember how it worked but I should look it up. 101 will be at an earlier time slot. Both of them on MW.</p>
