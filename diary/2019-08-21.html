<p>= Examen for Tuesday 8/20=</p>
<ul>
<li>What surprised me today? How sophisticated is Janey's understanding and approach to ministry. She is a capable bishop material that I would be glad to serve under. The passing of generations, but she is wise and smart. The conversation had been about St.Â Mark's and small churches.</li>
<li>What inspired me today? see above</li>
<li>What touched me today? the movie &quot;Stardust&quot; that was a fantasy love story. There was a news story about people caring for one another. The star character in thhe movie made reference to the combination of malicious evil that humans are capable of but at the same time the amazing egs. of love (esp. <span id="unconditional"></span><strong>unconditional</strong>)</li>
<li>What did I enjoy doing today? Successfully compiled the markdown editor &quot;Abricotine.&quot;</li>
<li>What would I like to more of? Driving to Dayton. I'm not really looking forward to a kind of empty time for me. I broached the bike rack for the car in anticipation of taking my bike to Florida. That seems a rewarding possibility that MP is skeptical of.</li>
<li>What would I like to do less of?</li>
<li>What did I learn today?</li>
<li>What will I do differently tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
