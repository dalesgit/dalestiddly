<p><em>&amp; the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> =</p>
<p>It is late. Time to have been in bed for an hour, but I'm not. I am getting to know &quot;Phaedrus&quot;. He is the alter-ego of the narrator. He is the person the narrator had been before he went insane. He is a thinker. He struggles to avoid the nihilism which is thought seems to thrust him. He understands the conversations about &quot;<em>a priori</em>&quot; and other extended metaphors. I read them now and remember back to the resonance they had for me when I was 20 y/o.</p>
<h2 id="Dreaming">Dreaming</h2>
<p>There was a kind of normalcy to my dreams. I can't actually remember them now. I have worked for a while. But they weren't disturbing although fantastic in a dream sort of way. Helped perhaps by reading the book before turning out the lights. I was able to recognize, or at least remember a little bit, my very young self as a 20 year-old, caught up in the reveries of the novel and its antagonist? <em>Phaedrus</em>.</p>
