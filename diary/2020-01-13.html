<p>Bill called. I laughingly said that &quot;discipline&quot; was not one of his strong suits. I laughed and said, &quot;Yeah, I'm sitting here having a scotch and smoking a cigarette.&quot; I'm worried about his taking to the rules of Diamond with re. smoking. He is convinced that eventually David will move to Cape Cod so that he can take care of Charlotte and Mary.</p>
<p>We watched a couple hours of <em>Irishman</em>. It is so well done. Essentially a narrative of the back-story and details of Frank Sheehan who claimed in a book that he was the killer of Jimmy Hoffa.</p>
<h1 id="meet-with-peter-meet-with-peter">Meet with Peter {#Meet with Peter}</h1>
<p>Schedule for fall is due this week. Most important to nail down time and room slots. I have volunteered for 11 &amp; 9 MW.</p>
<p>At this point it will be 1 section 101 &amp; 1 of 317. Two preps but variety and perhaps able to build on the numbers I got this semester?</p>
<p>Peter is teaching 316 this semester but there are only 11-12. He's got nearly 20 in his NT (is that his WF class?)</p>
