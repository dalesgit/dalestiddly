<p>I’m a blank face. Who am I? Sunday’s come and gone and I had no presence anywhere. Not since the 1970’s. Remembering my unhappiness at “missing” a significant percentage of my son’s life when he went with his mother to Echo Lake for a week at age 2 months. I drove across Utah on a US highway and nearly couldn’t buy diesel. 111 miles without service. Straight across nothingness.</p>
