<h1 id="Examen">Examen</h1>
<p>What were the best things about yesterday? I asked MP. She quickly responded that it was the call from Sean. She asked of me and I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>finishing the sermon</li>
<li>going on the bike ride</li>
<li>making the dinner (that she had planned and got ready)</li>
</ul>
<p>The call from Sean leads me to reconsider how quickly we get moved from Rock Hill. When he gets out he may need our stability. His voice and his reasoning sound remarkably healthy.</p>
