<h1 id="awe-shucks">Awe-shucks</h1>
<p>Dreaming in a setting with the atmosphere of “Oklahoma” – a kind of “awe-shucks” sort of thing. There wasn’t a frustration theme like yesterday. Just gatherings. Seemed like families. But more than that, community. After the dream I thought Mary Pat didn’t seem to be around, but I think she was there, somewhere.</p>
<p>I slept pretty well, waking often to pee. There’s a certain sort of cease-fire sense of peace, I guess. We can’t talk about what’s important to me. But I forgave her, I said so, anyway, for her injurious words – she apologized after praying together yesterday – and it seemed good to spend time together – a long day with Sean at work, watching a movie. But …</p>
<p>Two days of effort were attached to working at solving computer puzzles. I wanted to try the “Elive” distro. It’s supposed to be the best performing with the least overhead. But in trying to install it, which ran into difficulties, the old “Home” partition was deleted. At first nothing booted. Then I got it to boot. With old Antix drives I got the partition to show up, then the data showed up with gparted, then I figured out how to restore files to an old usb. The partitioning is screwed up, swap partition gone, but “Elive” is bootable and I have access to all the files I should want.</p>
<p>Elive does appear both beautiful and lean. Why is it that the browsers take up so much CPU as compared to 10 years ago. It so quickly goes to 100%. Otherwise the old computer might be usable.</p>
<p>But wait, it might be useful as a networked harddrive – even without a screen, keyboard etc. I would have some 60-80 gigs available. Interesting thought.</p>
<h1 id="convention-in-hawaii">Convention in Hawai’i</h1>
<p>I changed my mind about possibly attending. I registered this morning. I thought that I could get past my resentments and hurts. And that I might feel connected if I just listened and observed.</p>
