<p>Lydia and Emma were in it. But there was a difference. It was colored by my time last night with Pierson and Grace. My daughters were softer, more open, more open to grace and to appreciating what they had.</p>
<p>It wasn't realistic.</p>
<h1 id="ramp.-more-healing.-ramp.-more-healing.">Ramp. More healing. {#Ramp. More healing.}</h1>
<p>Today the ramp is scheduled to go in. Mary Pat is getting more independent. My conversation, however brief, with Peter was energizing. If I could have conversations with colleagues I could keep on moving forward in teaching. The struggle now will be in pulling back. He invited me to continue teaching if that seemed like the right thing. I imagined with him that the only reason to stop teaching was so that Mary Pat and I could travel. If that wasn't going to be in the cards then -- well, who knows?</p>

<p>Specifically Peter had said that I should talk with colleagues in politics -- perhaps a cross-listing. He mentioned that there has been recent writing about Church and Empire, primarily focused on Roman empire. He also is excited about the new book he's using in RELG 316 (I think it is) as a replacement for Placher.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the group that Grace said brought her parents together and into the Catholic Church. This is from a church in St.Â Petersburg (http://www.stpaulstpete.com/index.php/ministries/offertory-3/communion-and-liberation)</p>
