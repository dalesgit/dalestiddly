<li>Do you remember why we started the prayer group? Answer: to give you practice in praying in front of others.</li>
<li>Reason for asking that we meet was not to convince you of something. What had &quot;been a &quot;navigating&quot; the changes in a prayer group became an occasion for ending a spiritual relationship. It seemed important to be more intentional and more &quot;personal&quot; about that process.</li>
<li>What do you (Sue) have to learn through this process?</li>
