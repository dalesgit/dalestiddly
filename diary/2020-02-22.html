<p>Talking with Julian on his birthday yesterday I learned that Miriam and Mo are going on a Mediterranean cruise in a couple weeks. She asked Julian first but he turned her down. He said he wasn't really into cruising.</p>
<p>He also reports that he is trying to get all his back taxes taken care of. It has apparently been many years that he hasn't bothered with it. I think it's a good think that he's trying to take care of that mess. He has asked Owen for help. But what a mess! I just hope that he -- and Sean -- are trying to clean up their life and not just appease.</p>

<p>It is I guess I would say lonely. I can cope, but I keep thinking of mother, living on without George.</p>
<p>Often when Mary Pat is here I long for some quiet alone time. I do need that time. But now I'm kind overwhelmed with quiet and alone.</p>

<p>It may seem an odd thing to receive a &quot;greeting&quot; from South Carolina, particularly on the occasion of your appointment as rector of St. Mary's in Honolulu. You've probably already heard something about me. I was rector from 2001-2012. I want to give to you the greatest blessing I can on this occasion, because St. Mary's was one of the greatest blessings of my adult life. I loved the people there with all my heart and I received much love in return. Up to the present day, I tell stories about the amazing acts of God's grace that we shared. I think I can send you greetings, though I am living in South Carolina, because within weeks of my arrival in Hawai'i I felt deep within me that it was home. I still feel that way. I pray that God will bless you as mightily as He has me. Praise be.</p>
<p>Faithfully, The Rev. Dale C. Hathaway</p>

<p>ST. MARYʻS ANNOUNCES NEW RECTOR: THE REV. CHARLES BROWNING We are happy to announce the naming of a new priest for St. Mary’s Episcopal Church in Mo’ili’ili. A Florida native, Fr. Charles Browning will be coming to us from St. Andrew’s Chapel and School in Boca Raton, with his wife Cainna and two (soon to be three) children. Fr. Charles is an avid surfer, reader, movie-watcher, collector of vinyl LPs, and fan of science fiction (and especially Japanese giant monster movies). In addition, he is a writer, having had poetry and short fiction published in small-print journals. In 2019, his essay on soteriology, “The Joy of Salvation,” was published by Covenant, the blog of The Living Church. He is also one-third of the Masters of Divinity podcast. E komo mai, Browning family! Fr. Charles begins his call on April 1, 2020.</p>

<p>Peter, I had thought that we had already talked about next year's schedule. This morning I realized we really hadn't. If you still want me I would sign up for 2 sections next spring. Your choice how you divvy it up. The schedule we chose for the fall is fine. But something else might work also if it's better when you do up the schedule.</p>
