<p>Last night intense dreaming. There was pastoral ministry in Hawai’i. Then rehearsing thoughts about my relationship with Mary Pat. I don’t know if any of it was healthy.</p>
<p>I thought that I stay quiet, refrain from much conversation because when I say something, it is either:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Interrupted before it is finished or treated with dismissive feeling, “Oh,” before moving on to something “important.”</li>
<li>Negating or arguing with whatever I said.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yesterday I realized another element that evokes Bridget. MP expects me to be stupid or abusive in what I say. My words are filtered through such a lens. That came out when she described her immediate response to me in the exchange about her hair. She was saying that her hair dresser had shaved her head. She asked the question, “When did she do that?” and tried to sort it out. I started saying, “Well, she didn’t exactly shave it and it went through various cuts every 3 weeks.” Her response was based on a strong gut response along the lines, “What does he think he’s saying? I was there. I know that she took a razor to my head. How dare he speak for me.”</p>
<p>In processing this, I tried to say that having the thought, “How could he say that?” is a clue that she could pause and ask, “What does he mean?” In this case, it is really only after a night’s sleep that I realize the diffence was in language use. She said “shave” and meant that her barber had used a razor or shaver to cut her hair. I understood “shave” to mean that it was the process that Sean and Owen have used on their head and men use on their face. I spoke largely because Sean wasn’t there and couldn’t have known exactly what her cut looked like.</p>

<p>Dreaming also about response to Will’s 50th birthday. I can tell him a bit about my memories of mine. I could even give him the dollar that Nielsen gave me as a kind of token parallel to mine.</p>
