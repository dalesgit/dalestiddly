<p>Last night, the blanket pulled off my hind end. It was cold. Pulling the blanket back.</p>
<p>Remembering sleeping bags. First 20+ years lots of that. Being cold.</p>
<p>Mom sent me to Steamboat Springs in summer. To have a father replacement time?</p>
<p>Trotting on the horse down the road and in slow motion rotating of to hit the road.</p>
<p>Peeing in the bag at night. Too cold to get out in the middle of the night? Too ashamed to tell anyone that my bag was soaked.</p>
<p>Thinking there is nobody who cares about those memories. But last night, anyway, they seemed so much a part of me. Or so much some of the pieces of who I am.</p>
<p>Having read Louise Gluckâ€™s poem on saying goodbye to the body.</p>
