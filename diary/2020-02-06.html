<h1 id="fathers-and-sons-scott-brian-fathers-and-sons-scott-brian">Fathers and sons, Scott &amp; Brian {#Fathers and sons, Scott &amp; Brian}</h1>
<p>Thu Feb 06, 2020 12:26 PM</p>
<p>Brian is drinking. In Scott's former treatment they said, &quot;pole-vaulting over turds.&quot;</p>
<p>Feeling both optimism and doubt at the same time. Not the same as a &quot;yes/but&quot;.</p>
<p>Any stories of fathers doing the right thing by their sons? I can't think of any. Odysseus, Joyce's Ulysses, Prodigal Son / Father, <em>Fathers and Sons</em>, Siddhartha.</p>
<p>Scott's going to try to find the book. We shared feeling of church / AA attendance which I compared to P. Seeger saying, &quot;Even if we don't win, we've spent our time with the good people.&quot; In this case it's the folks who are on a similar journey to our own. People who long for the transcendence. Even though for the most part e.g.Â most of the people in church are just going through the motions for tradition's sake.</p>
