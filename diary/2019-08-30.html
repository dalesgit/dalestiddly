<li>&quot;ecumenism is that thing that if we had a better word for it we would have more of it.&quot;</li>
<li>The best critique of what's wrong is the practice of doing what is right. (Walter Brueggemann)</li>
<li>Shane: conversation with rabbi. We disagree with lots of things. E.g. Judaism did away with the death penalty a long time ago. It's ironic that many Christians distort OT passages and that's not even dealing with the thing of Jesus.</li>
<li>A lot of Christianity doesn't pass the smell test (smell milk first before drinking). Doesn't smell like Jesus.</li>
<li>Vision of love and justice and freedom for everyone.</li>

<p>This is an update-report on the prayer-group meeting yesterday that was attended by Mary Pat, Olga-Maria, and myself. As we had talked about at the meeting at our house a few weeks ago, the purpose for yesterday's meeting was to decide on some of the specifics for going forward with the group. Our time together at the WELCM house was prayerful and I think grace-full. We came to several conclusions about the immediate future of the group:</p>
<ul>
<li>The place and time for the meeting will be the WELCM house, 4:30 pm on Thursdays.</li>
<li>The format will be a simplified lectio or African Bible study method.</li>
<li>the meeting will be open to students and hopefully it will become a part of the student's &quot;programming&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons for re-imagining the group as a part of the programming for the campus ministry was that we would need the ministry's governing board's approval to meet there. We each had an intuitive sense that it was &quot;appropriate&quot; at several levels, that a kind of &quot;radical hospitality&quot; was at the center of all prayer and especially prayer groups, and that we all grow from relationships that are outside our norms.</p>
<p>The next meeting will be 4:30 pm, Sept. 5 at WELCM house.</p>

<p>Sue I am sending out a notice to each of us involved with the prayer group, reporting on the decisions that our conversation yesterday brought us to. I'm sending you this note because you had voiced concerns about the concept of inviting students from campus ministry to be a part of the prayer group.</p>
<p>Each of the three of us yesterday sensed a clear convergence of vision around something happening at the WELCM location. Olga-Maria is experiencing right now an expansion of that ministry in various ways that will be unfolding over the coming weeks and months. She gave a powerful witness to the ministry there being one of offering what she called &quot;radical hospitality.&quot; In the note to the whole group I try to identify several points of our further reasoning.</p>
<p>Most of all I wanted you to have a heads up so you could pray about and reflect on the meaning of the prayer group for you. I would very much welcome conversation with you about it if you would like. I leave that to you. In the meantime, get well and we'll see you soon.</p>
