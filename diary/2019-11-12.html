<h1 id="sisters-sjostrom-sisters-sjostrom">Sisters Sjostrom {#Sisters Sjostrom}</h1>
<p>The sisters are a group of poisonous snakes. I don't like snakes. That Beth would say I don't want you to leave in anger. That would be like Dale's family. She wanted us out of the house, just not in anger. I felt my family was judged. I blew it.</p>
<p>How much my fault. Beth didn't want me there. She said so even before I got there. She got her wish.</p>
<p>MP said, &quot;I can't believe that when it came it was Beth who did it.&quot;</p>
<h1 id="grieving-abuse-grieving-abuse">Grieving abuse {#Grieving abuse}</h1>
<p>Over and over again I witness it.</p>
<ul>
<li>unnamed couple in Michigan City who hadn't formally gone through a divorce. The widow returned and flexed her power for the sake of the money</li>
<li>Mary Jean being offended and demanding others listen that my mother discreetly came to mourn her former husband's death (my dad)</li>
<li>Bridget's sister and her, &quot;You don't have the right to speak here.&quot; - Shirley foisting her views on all comers at her own mother's funeral</li>
<li>Beth manipulating her sister out of the care-giver's picture</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it people demanding that no one infringe on their particular grieving? Is it demanding the right to dictate how other people may grieve? Is it refusing to allow others to grieve? Is it greed? Is it power?</p>
