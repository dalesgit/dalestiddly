<p>Sleeping is challenging in the small bed at MP's house. Bill called and reported that he is ready to send cover letters with the checks. I admitted to him that moving into retirement is challenging. I told him of my going back and forth with whether or not I should teach -- that was with regard to scheduling Mom's ashes. That will wait for him until he and Karla bring to a close the issues related to her step-mother's estate.</p>
<p>I feel ok about the $ going to my grandchildren. I do think, however, that I should make a gift to Julian.</p>
<p>I have begun a list in Zotero of readings related to retirement. It is helpful. A useful model that I kind of like is Aslan's approach where there is a wealth of citations and notes. But his narrative is looser and lighter, almost breezy.</p>
<p>Bill said something about Emma being inclined to spend her inheritance on traveling to Tahiti. I'm thinking about the girls as I read an article from <em>The Guardian</em> on []{#parental alienation}<strong>parental alienation</strong>. Cf. &quot;Joplin&quot;.</p>
