<p>MP wrote an amazing draft of a letter that could be mailed to her sisters. It is so well-written but also profoundly self-aware and sensitive to connections. It illustrates much of the reasons for falling in love and marrying her.</p>
<p>The question is, then, whether to send it to them. I really don't know and wouldn't try to determine that. I remembered Dick H. coaching me through the letter addressed to Tim Vail after is outrageous response to me at Emma's graduation. I told MP that as Dick H. left it entirely up to me whether to send it or not, and I chose not to send it, nevertheless in recent years, as the estrangement with Emma has turned into a lifetime, I have at times regretted not sending it.</p>
