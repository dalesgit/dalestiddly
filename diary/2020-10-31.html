<h1 id="nostalgia-for-hawaii-dreams">Nostalgia for Hawai’i (Dreams)</h1>
<p>I don’t remember any of it. Nothing except a kind of repetition of “Hawai’i”, “Hawai’i”, “Hawai’i”.</p>
<p>I couldn’t sleep after having slept an hour. I hadn’t taken my pills. I did that and ate a piece of cheese. It seemed to go better.</p>
<h1 id="subiaco">Subiaco</h1>
<p>The writer of the reflection in <em>Give us this day</em> was from Subiaco Abbey in Arkansas. I wanted see further about the name. And, of course, re-discovered that Subiaco was the birth place of Benedict. But also Gina Lollobrigida and Lucrezia Borgia. She was the daughter of the cardinal who became Pope Alexander VI . The Borgia’s, in her lifetime, came to their <em>denoument</em>  but she apparently survived that part. The description of her “adventures”  reminded me suddenly of Ivanka Trump. Lust for power. Privileged life that gave her tremendous opportunities. Child of a tyrant, probably of a narcissist. I wondered if a near comparison with the Trumps might be the Borgia’s in Renaissance Italy.</p>
<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>The author, from Arkansas, quoted Dorothy Day, looking out at the terrible things going on in the world (1969) for her and she pondered what there was to do? Seemingly despair was a reasonable choice. She was asked by someone, “What would you do?” She replied, “I would keep on doing what I am doing.”</p>
<p>I thought of it in part in the context of Macron’s France in the wake of 2 sensational murders made in the name of Allah and because of a cartoon printed of the prophet Muhammad. Lectures I listened to had to do with the growth of Rabbinic Judaism and the response of the Trinitarian and Christology orthodoxies. I had occasion to think again that I felt myself to be more Jewish than Christian. But I reflected that the Christian controversies were driven by the constraints of “monotheism.” I wondered that so much violence has been perpetrated, particularly in France, by Muslims, avenging the “blasphemy” directed at Muhammad. But, I wondered, isn’t that the same thing that Muslims accuse Christians of having done?</p>
<p>I wonder if there are any Muslim leaders, teachers, mullahs, who are thinking along the same lines?</p>
<p>I see the world criticizing Macron for taking a hard line against those who would commit atrocities because some wrote or spoke ironically, even sarcastically, about the human named Muhammad.</p>
