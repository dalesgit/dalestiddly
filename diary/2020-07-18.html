<h1 id="at-ginis-at-ginis">At Gini's {#At Giniâ€™s}</h1>
<p>I was touched by the fact that Annie led the gang in purchasing masks from Julian. They made a connection with my family that was gratifying. It involved Julian -- and I love him the best anyway!</p>
<p>Beth approached me this morning and was intent in a compulsive sort of way to get an apology to me accomplished. The woundedness stretched all the way back to her first encounter with me which was vicarious, ie. on the Alaskan cruise. Mary Pat was so in love with me that Beth felt rejected. She knew it wasn't me and she used the phrase that she knew I was good for Mary Pat. I reassured her that it was over and she need not worry again about it. It felt like a sacramental confession.</p>
<p>Reading <em>When the heart waits</em>, Sue Monk Kidd. On most of the pages I feel like she and I have read most of the same people in our life.</p>
<h1 id="Imagining">Imagining</h1>
<p>In reading the beginning of <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>, I imagined that I could begin writing a fantasy myself. Framed or built by images from my train ride or attempt to get to the altar on time. Then following where the story leads. Setting my imagination free.</p>
<p>It's like the passion that Sue Monk Kidd is evoking. The <em>pathos</em> that can tell the whole story of the caterpillar's journey to becoming a butterfly.</p>
<p>Amazingly, earlier in the day the TV in the living room was showing a special that Katy had recorded on the natural history of butterflies. The photography was breathtaking. The story even more so. There is a butterfly that migrates twice as far as monarch butterflies, from Africa, across the Sahara and Mediterranean up to northern Europe. Scientists had long known that they disappeared there before re-emerging in Africa. Only recently apparently have scientists discovered that at the end of their journey they soar high into the air an capture strong wind currents that carry them back in a matter of days to their place of origins.</p>
