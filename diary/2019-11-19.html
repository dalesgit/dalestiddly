<p>So I wake up this morning before 6, quite unable to sleep. We are home together for the first time since the end of September. MP's sisters have cast her out of their midst -- it's a system vomiting out the alien dynamic that doesn't fit their way of doing things. That's what I was thinking about when I decided to just go ahead and get up. It' &quot;Katy's house.&quot; They needed the &quot;eggs&quot; that she laid for them. I was mistaken in my appraisal of the family and probably helped to set her up for the terrible disappointment she had.</p>
<p>I really despise the manner that most families, apparently, -- maybe it's just some, but ... -- the way families respond at the time of death.</p>
<p>Deception. Inability to tell the truth or to be transparent. Manipulation. Willingness to hurt others who have a right to be a part of the grieving process.</p>
<p>Can I get back to a sense of being &quot;me&quot;?</p>
<h1 id="huge-response----no-do-overs-huge-response-no-do-overs">Huge response -- no do overs {#Huge response â€“ no do overs}</h1>
<p>I went through the process of gathering information about the things needing scheduling and decisions: the garage door, the trees,</p>
<p>MP had done her presentation then was working on SPA report.</p>
<p>I went over the dollar figures and she basically caved to &quot;do whatever you think is the best.&quot; I didn't feel the support I had hoped for but I figured I could go ahead.</p>
<p>Then she said, &quot;I something I want you to do.&quot; I paused, then said, &quot;OK.&quot; She said I want you to make an appointment by tomorrow to do something about your cataract. It really scared me when you said that you couldn't see.&quot;</p>
<p>I was so frustrated. Being given an ultimatum. She asked what do you want? (or some such.)</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Well, the only thing that seemed attractive was to go (to Warwar's. But now I don't want to go to Dayton ever -- (pausing, knowing that I have just said a devastating something) unless I have to. My thought process was -- as I had thought the past few days -- that I would go back for a funeral but that's all.</p>
<p>She hasn't really been able to look at me since all day. There are too many echoes of Bridget's mother -- and I just want to scream.</p>
