<ul>
<li>What surprised me today? Mary Pat's new computer. It looks very inviting. Not as much to her.</li>
<li>What inspired me today? Writing my sermon. I felt the spirit driving me.</li>
<li>What touched me today? That Olga-Maria responded with eagerness to the invitation to prayer group. MP and I talked about our approach. First we'll pray, then talk about pattern we want for future prayer sessions. I shared that all of the successful groups have had a pretty strong format. The serendipity comes on top of the format. An example of a group that was not edifying was the Lay Marianist group I was with. Too much of Dennis' ego driving it?</li>
</ul>
<p>FROM CHARLES CAVE</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I enjoy doing today? Cleary the writing. But I also said to MP that my reasons for teaching were:
<ul>
<li>intellectual stimulation</li>
<li>touching young people</li>
<li>getting out of the house</li>
<li>providing grist for my preaching</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What would I like to more of? Exercise. Gardening perhaps?</li>
<li>What would I like to do less of?</li>
<li>What did I learn today? Annie Oakley (cf.Â the movie we watched) I decided that I can write a pretty straightforward email to IT re. online teaching, asking if they could accept me as certified. Perhaps that will drive my decision about teaching? MP is making references to my possibly teaching as an impediment to planning travels. We have a companion travel ticket to use. Also some vacation packages from Interval. The other thing I have to do is find out about Bill's plans for mid-December.</li>
<li>What will I do differently tomorrow? Call Bill. Mary Pat reminds that the last time I took her to a church I was excited about was the 2nd time to Monroe. Both times she missed the first date because of Amy.</li>
