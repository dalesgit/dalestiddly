<h1 id="memories">Memories</h1>
<p>So many memories:</p>
<ul>
<li>visiting at the Museum of Science and Industry. Not in later years with my children, but when I was still a youth. The oversized chair. The dinosaur. The u-boat I wanted to tour but didn’t, then.</li>
<li>Playing caanasta with Peter into the wee hours. Or Monopoly in such a way that we could keep the game going on indefinitely.</li>
<li>The spook big trees at their old house. I was afraid they would blow down in the storms that were common in the summers.</li>
<li>Late the chance to see Suzanne’s breasts that I gave up. The smelling of pubic areas with Peter as still a boy. Later her breasts in innocence in the basement of 690 Dudley. Perhaps Peter’s predilections were a part of his early death?</li>
<li>Lydia asked for Pastor’s carrots recipe last night. I delivered today.</li>
<li>My own hard heartedness? How do I explain it? Understand it? But it’s very real.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someday all the memories will just vanish. Like the files in this computer when they’re expunged. Quickly at the blink of an eye. When I don’t intend it.</p>
<p>Ancient the reflection that are lives are but the blinking of an eye. In today’s world we can more easily recognize that human existence – perhaps 1-2 million years? – is but the blinking of an eye.</p>
<p>What is all this knowledge for?</p>
<p>As a youth I wondered – literally had wonder about – the fact that I was a person who could think the thoughts that I was, and that if I were a young person living in, say, Zaire, as it was then known, or perhaps it was the Belgian Congo when I reflected such, that if I were that young man I would be thinking very different thoughts.</p>
<p>Oh, the wonder.</p>
