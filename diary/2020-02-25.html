<p>#grief Whenever I dream about Bob Fitzpatrick, I feel anger towards him, judgmental, and critical of his decision-making and ability to lead the church. It brings with it a memory of him telling me that I needed to catch the wave and that sometimes one needed to work past midnight and sprint, rather than run the marathon. This was at a time I was trying to describe my desire to be a long-term pastor. He wanted miracle transformations, now, and he wanted me to do what he wanted me to do. The way he jettisoned so many clergy who didn't see things the way he did.</p>
<p>But it also brings with it a memory of him telling me about Bridget that he knew she had told the girls things that no parent should tell a child. This in the context of alienation with Emma. So the girls are in my mind -- and I can't sleep any more.</p>
<p>It was time to get up anyway.</p>
<p>Yesterday I listened to another &quot;On Poetry&quot; and it was awesome.</p>

<p>:boundaries:</p>
<p>Miriam Hathaway is with Lee Corum. Yesterday at 6:01 PM · We said goodbye to Kuma at home tonight. We are all too sad for words, so I read this to her in her final moments:</p>
<p>Dear Kuma,</p>
<p>You were a good girl. You were a gentle spirit to the end, a brave and trusting girl who always did things in your own way.</p>
<p>Like how you did NOT like peanut butter the way most dogs do, but you liked Brussels sprouts. (Though you were always a sucker for American cheese and hot dogs.)</p>
<p>You hated fluffy dog beds and furniture, instead choosing to lie on the hard floor, resting in the hallway, between everyone’s bedrooms so you could keep an eye on us. Or next to Will by the couch, keeping vigil, when he had pneumonia.</p>
<p>You didn’t go outside to pee just once. Instead, you peed on every tree, bush, and tiny bed of moss for every six feet of our walks.</p>
<p>You taught me a lot. You taught me that it was okay to pet your belly if you rolled over, but NOT your dainty white paws. I could sit next to you, but could NOT sitnext to you. I could never, never, not ever trim your nails. You taught me about boundaries – that being clear and consistent creates trust and real devotion.</p>
<p>You taught me how to delight in snow. How you’d frolic in it, flakes floating on the tips of your thick fur, unmelting, as if they were hitching a ride on you just to share in your joy.</p>
<p>You taught me about friendship. That it’s okay to be socially awkward, drooling long shoelaces from your mouth as you trotted through the dog park. That you can have BFFs like Goose, Izzy, and Gia, even though you hardly saw them in person (in dog?), or even at all.</p>
<p>You taught me how to hunt. I’m sure you had big dreams of catching a caribou or even just a squirrel. Though you never did, you did catch countless flies buzzing along our windowsills, spitting them out like spicy popcorn. And two moles. Which I’m fine with. And I’m sorry I screamed when you caught that mouse in our kitchen, which startled you and made it skitter away, scot-free.</p>
<p>You taught me to be brave when saying goodbye. When I was pregnant and in labor with River, Lee and I drove away from the house toward the hospital, and I cried and cried because I knew you were no longer going to be my only baby. I was so sad to leave you. And when we made the decision to say goodbye now, I am equal parts heartbroken and faithful that we are offering you the best sendoff we can. You taught me that all goodbyes, no matter what, are driven by love.</p>
<p>I will miss running my finger between your eyebrows and cupping your triangle bat ears. I will miss the way you clean your face with your front paws. And I will always be grateful for what you taught us and the memories of you that we will carry into the snow, the wilderness, and beyond.</p>
<p>Love, your girl, Miriam</p>
