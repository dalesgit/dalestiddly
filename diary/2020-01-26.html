<h1 id="karlas-birthday-karlas-birthday">Karla's birthday {#Karla’s birthday}</h1>
<p>Sun Jan 26, 2020 07:16 AM Mary Pat's gift for Karla on her birthday were splendid. It made K. feel valued. There were numerous occasions for the two of them to hug.</p>
<ul>
<li>foldup bag</li>
<li>broken plumeria pin</li>
<li>toilet paper rolls</li>
<li>bag from Diamond</li>
</ul>
<p>I was so glad for both of them.</p>
<p>Marvelous dinner. She met at alum of St. Mary's College where she had gone to her first year of college.</p>
<p>I heard the story for the first time I think of Karla's return. She said that she knew her mother wasn't doing well. She promised her mother that she would return from the east coast. But she didn't get home after the school year before her mother had killed herself.</p>
<p>Oh, my, fraught with blame and regrets. Setting the stage for the rest of K.'s life.</p>

<p>We had a terrible experience at the session for &quot;Owner's update.&quot; We ended up being accused of &quot;fraud&quot;. It became clear to us that at some point they will take away our &quot;Platinum&quot; status. Probably the <span id="fraud"></span><strong>fraud</strong> came in Orlando when we bought our points. MP is considering telling them that it was deceptive and giving back the points.</p>
