<h1 id="source-of-anxiety-source-of-anxiety">Source of anxiety? {#Source of anxiety?}</h1>
<p>One part of me thinks that the anxiety I felt the other night was related to the upcoming *<span id="retirement"></span><strong>retirement</strong>* that will leave me with little incentive to develop my mind and curiosity. Compare the way my music inventiveness went the wayside after leaving parish ministry. Or compare the way I gave up a whole range of publication interest. Or at Chaminade my developing interest in Catholic thought of religious pedagogy.</p>
<p>Read yesterday about the past convention of AAR and a concern that the teaching of religion be taught with an awareness of the most recent *[]{#learning theories}<strong>learning theories</strong>*. It seemed so bogus and scientifically jargonny to me. It wasn't that that I was interested in. But maybe I have something to learn there?</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-for-miriam-draft-2-for-miriam">Draft 2 for Miriam {#Draft 2 for Miriam}</h1>
<p>It was never my intention to cut off contact with you. I am sorry for having hurt you. It was never my intention to do that.</p>
<p>Putting it that way serves as a reminder to me that part of what I tried to say in our last conversation was that &quot;in spite of good intentions, often a different result occurs from what we intended.&quot; I kept repeating &quot;unintended consequences.&quot; What I meant was that our intentions and the results of our decisions and actions don't necessarily line up. We often end up hurting others even when it is not our intention. I speak of and for myself.</p>
<p>I have experienced a deep sense of family -- what it means to be father, daughter, brother, sister -- with Mary Pat's family. I think it may be similar to what my brother David experienced with his in-laws. Maybe Bill and Shirley with their in-laws also. It might well be true for you. I don't know. Sadly, -- and it may well be because of my mistakes -- my family has not been able to provide the same sense of family.</p>
<p>When talking about my family, some of my friends have said to me things like, &quot;I can't imagine doing that ... as a (parent, brother, son).&quot; I am not totally off my rocker for expecting certain things of &quot;family.&quot; But an ordinary family is not what I have. I have a broken one. Of course one of my assumptions for many years is that most, if not all, people come from broken families. I observe that some take <span id="alienation"></span><strong>alienation</strong> to be an expected outcome in a family. Others do not. I just have to accept that my family is what it is.</p>
<p>Some of my friends have been heroic in their actions as (parent, brother, son). I admire them so much. I wish I could be more open with you about that, but their story is not my story to tell. In rather bitter contrast I have seen members of my family -- []{#not you be assured}<strong>not you be assured</strong> -- in actions that are abominable, venal, dishonest, disrespectful -- I could go on. It makes a difference what we do and how we act. I am quite certain the family member I'm talking about would have wonderful things to say about his/her intentions. Forgive me if it sounds like I'm ranting or lecturing. I'm not intending that. I want to be vulnerable with you and honest at the same time.</p>
<p>When we talked I was feeling especially hurt at what feels like other people stealing my children from me. Anger at what other people have done to hurt my children. I have no right to expect that you would in fact be able to empathize with my pain, but I do know of the deep devotion and love you have for your own children. I am grateful for that devotion. I forget that I am not just anybody off the street to you, but a father who was divorced from your mother when you were but quite young.</p>
<p>Sometimes I just wish that I could be a father with a daughter the way I see others enjoying it. I actually really love being a grandfather. I forget that all of my children have issues with me and that I will never have such a relationship. It makes me sad.</p>
<p>I do not want there to be broken relations with you and your family. I apologize for the actions I have done that have contributed to the brokenness. Please forgive me.</p>
<p>Love, Dad</p>
