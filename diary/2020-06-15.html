<li>moved living around</li>
<li>discovered answers to 2 questions about church insurance: 1) $380 per year for Mary Pat to have same insurance I do, and 2) I have 10 counseling sessions per year for all in household</li>
<li>what else? did a picture of my tasks in online certification in Freeplane. It helps I guess.</li>
<li>I began work on sermon. Fielded gratitude emails from both churches.</li>
