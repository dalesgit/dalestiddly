<h1 id="dream-with-bridget-dream-with-bridget">Dream with Bridget {#Dream with Bridget}</h1>
<p>I know I have to get up in the morning, today it was 6:45 am, when I am feeling the ache in my heart from the absence of Lydia and Emma. That invariably means the shadow of Bridget lurking in the background. Yesterday I had a very abbreviated exchange of messages with Lydia. It was at my prompting and it was if her responses barely went past &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. It feels like a slap from her, but probably shouldn't really be taken &quot;personally&quot;.</p>
<p>The instigation may have been the image from the movie we watched, by Angelina Jolie, about the war between Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina from 1992-95. The love affair at the heart of the aching cruelty of it all was poignant. The woman's nakedness was so exposed. Her rape and violation so vivid. And the final scene was of the soldier executing her with a shot to the head.</p>
<p>That kind of cruelty is what I felt from Bridget.</p>

<ul>
<li>finalized the exam and the paper</li>
<li>I feel good about the way the paper is an extension of the discussion thread this week</li>
<li>the exam is ok because it is really an exercise in compiling answers and the test is just a regurgitation of the work</li>
<li>is it too much work? too much expectation?</li>
<li>a walk. My pace is ca. 2.75 mph. Listened to Carlo Rovelli &quot;All Reality Is Interaction&quot; cf.</li>
