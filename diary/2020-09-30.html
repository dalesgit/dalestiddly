<h1 id="something-about-silences">Something about silences</h1>
<p>In my dream there was a combination of software kind of issues and a systematic effort to inject silences. There was something about how I was going about it, some kind of trick. There were different keys in the silences. They were somehow subversive. I was having trouble with it.</p>
<p>I looked across in the bed to MP sleeping. Far apart now. I, at least, feel a great distance with Sean in the puzzle. She addressed us as, “Does anybody …” And I felt so touchy about being grouped with Sean that my response was, “I’m not anybody.” She thought that was over-sensitive or something and made fun of it. But she addressed me as Dale.</p>
<h1 id="melded-psyches">Melded psyches?</h1>
<p>I think one of the things going on with me these past months is the following. The boundaries between MP and me were blurred. Others (Christina) may have seen it as a strong healthy marriage. Perhaps at some level. But it was precarious by other measures. When Sean appeared, his mother took on much of his psyche. Then there were 3. I never bargained for that. I was increasingly uncomfortable with the way in which my emotions, thoughts, world views were being subsumed or overlooked. I knew I was going to have to be better at carving out my own time and space – e.g. the tv watching.</p>
<p>Sean has accelerated all that.</p>
