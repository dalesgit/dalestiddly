<p>Sense of well-being in my sleep. I awaken with what seems like an odd thought, that I feel lonely. It's connected with a statement yesterday MP made to Amy on the phone, that we would most likely move to Florida. And I had the thought -- or a feeling really -- that I would like to have family around. Maybe it's something like Lydia's deep sense of needing to move to where her sense of &quot;family&quot; was, i.e. South Bend. I don't think it's such a great thing for her, nor would it be for me, I think, and yet ...</p>
<p>Mary Pat feels the same thing, and yet she's the one who moved away from family early on and has never looked back. I remarked yesterday that I have been in Orlando 4 times, but it's not a place I want to live in. But either of the 2 places we've stopped at previously I could be satisfied with.</p>
<p>I miss being in a place where a liberal or progressive perspective is dominant, and I certainly couldn't live in the same environment that Judy lives in: she has a concealed carry permit, is an outdoorsy kind of woman who fits with the Florida country culture that is, I think, deeply &quot;red.&quot;</p>
