<h1 id="lectio">Lectio</h1>
<p>It’s not fair! Kingdom of Heaven: Like a landowner … I ended with being struck by the way in which I need to live my days, one day at a time.</p>
<p>Kerr, landowner gave them a job, so they had an assignment from the get go. Something to be grateful for.</p>
<p>Each day a day to be grateful for. The students were fabulous.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-end-the-day-collapsed">In the end the day collapsed</h1>
<p>MP wanted to go to bed early. I think she was angry at me. Don’t know why. Maybe she didn’t think I stirred the soup appropriately. Maybe she wanted me to volunteer to go get Sean because she repeated several times that she was “so tired.”</p>
<p>After supper we watched the show with a Syrian refugee doctor. Then she announced that she was going to bed, asking me what I was going to do. I said I’d be in shortly. Sean announced that he was going to watch some show he wanted to see. I announced that I would be leaving the living room, they both knew that it was in disgust.</p>
<p>I came to bed and almost finished the book <em>Why? the Holocaust?</em> Depressing stuff. And unbending and principled in a way, but overthrowing some assumptions of the modern world, but leaving things at a heavy existentialist sort of decision-point.</p>
<p>That’s what I feel. I don’t think the marriage is going to make it. Because MP will always choose her son over me. And I don’t think I can make it until he leaves. I can’t abide his attitude of privilege and entitlement … (deservingness)? which is fostered by what I think is correctly named by Linda MP’s codependency.</p>
