<p>Yesterday was a full day of being in Dayton. It continues to seem like Gini has a fondness for me. More than just &quot;approves&quot;. I sat with her while Kate and MP went to grocery store.</p>
<p>I was able to bail out the last part of MP's dinner and she was grateful. The food was delicious -- Indian chicken. The best part of the day for me was reading Aslan's <em>God</em>. It is an overview of material that is covered in a &quot;textbooky&quot; sort of way with the Pearson book. Aslan is more discursive and imaginative and just as incisive.</p>
<p>I wonder about using it in a course. I downloaded a page of links to from several other 101 courses. It was to give an idea of a somewhat different approach to the class than I take, working on ways in my head that I could adjust, all the while uncertain of whether I will -- or want to -- or ought to -- teach it. Kind of leaning not to, but really going back and forth.</p>
