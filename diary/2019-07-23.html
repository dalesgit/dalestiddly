<p>I found old St.Â Mary's files. Looked briefly through some of them. Great nostalgia prompter. I notified Richert who would be happy to have them. I plan on sharing them this morning via Google Drive.</p>
<p>Mary Pat was depressed through much of the day. She deflected anything I offered by way of distraction or affirmation. Perhaps I had done or was doing something she disliked, but she wouldn't tell me.</p>
<p>I got a fair amount of organization going with boxes and files to throw away. My report from the periodontist was positive. The negative was that my dental plan pays virtually nothing on &quot;periodontal cleaning&quot; which is different from &quot;ordinary cleaning.&quot;</p>
