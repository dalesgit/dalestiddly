<p>The state of the marriage relationship is so pitiful. MP was deeply cutoff from me as we left counseling. I was left feeling like the only thing holding us together was my reluctance to say, “Ok, it’s done.”</p>
<p>Feelings as I awoke this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>a failure – to sustain a 3rd marriage</li>
<li>discouraged – that there is any way forward for me</li>
<li>wondering re. the way Janet seemed almost to interrogate me: “Why do Mary Pat’s accusations and claims count for something and mine don’t?”</li>
<li>Janet seemed keen on the “hurts” that were controlling us. I thought, “Mary Pat has just as many deep”hurts&quot; and they seem to control her regularly. Thinking:
<ul>
<li>The incident with Sean &amp; Amy, “losing” custody of her son, in part because of the way the step-father felt</li>
<li>she suspected illicit sexual intentions on ex-husband’s part</li>
<li>lying and cheating by ex-husband</li>
<li>bringing Sean to live with her Hawai’i in the midst of full-blown addiction</li>
<li>burned and stolen from</li>
<li>her own cheating in first marriage</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
