<p>First day back at school. I went into 101 classes where the students had presentations and what I was going to do was draw from them &quot;patterns&quot; in order to get them to think about the presentations and begin to draw conclusions about different approaches to Simon Wiesenthal's religious questions re. Holocaust and forgiveness.</p>
<p>By and large it was satisfying.</p>
<ul>
<li>asking whether one has the <span id="power"></span><strong>power</strong> to forgive</li>
<li>at least one noting the <span id="power"></span><strong>power</strong> of forgiveness itself</li>
<li>Christians starting from an assumption of the <span id="assumption"></span><strong>assumption</strong> of divine law of forgiveness</li>
</ul>
