<p>20201001151507 Mary Pat asks, &quot;Did I have a good time?&quot; once the Judges left. It was such a long day: 2 liturgies, preaching at St.Â Paul's. Cleaning the house for dinner guests. The dinner.</p>
<p>I answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; And left it at that. There was a keen sense of comfort level and <span id="sympatico"></span><strong>sympatico</strong> with Peter and Christina. And the fact that we can connect as couples adds to it. Peter made reference explicitly to his ordination and spoke briefly but wistfully about missing <span id="ministry"></span><strong>ministry</strong>. There was so much to connect with -- down to his being in Salzburg as &quot;learning German&quot; process.</p>
<p>I loaned him my <span id="Borges"></span><strong>Borges</strong> book. I really do want it back. I probably won't see it again, and I didn't like it that Mary Pat was the one to suggest that I was loaning it.</p>

<p>= Bill called at 7:30 pm ==</p>
<p>He said that Mom was mostly despondent, but she bounced back at one point that she could eat her lunch. She talked a little with BIll and he got her to do a little puzzle (3 questions). When he talked to the nurse she obviously felt like Mom could go at any moment. But then she bounced back. Bill sounded weary and has decided to stay some more days.</p>
<p>Karla said that she wishes she could be there to help him. I said the same thing. I felt connected to both of them. Mary Pat observes that if I weren't teaching, I would be down there. That's probably true.</p>
<p>I told Bill that now he was going through the dying process. He remembered that he had been with Mom and George just shortly before he died, but that he wasn't present for the time of death.</p>
<p>I suggested that he raise the topic of <span id="hospice"></span><strong>hospice</strong>. He said that that sounded like a good idea. It would be better for Mom and would get her out of the care that is only oriented toward recovery. If he asks we can get a sense of how the medical folks see it at this point.</p>
<p>In a later call that Mary Pat made to Karla, we heard an amazing account of mom reaching out to Shirley. Karla reported that, as mom awoke from one of her stupor and said, &quot;Oh, is that my Shirley?&quot;</p>
