<p>Dayton. Last night I learned about Caroline. A new sister. My <span id="real"></span><strong>real</strong> family here in Dayton wanted to know all about it and kept asking questions.</p>
<p>Today I have got my assignments and assessment sheets into BlackBoard in preparation for classes. I didn't grade all the papers I wanted to but I got what needed to be done.</p>
<p>There is some consensus that Shirley couldn't intend well with her trip to Las Cruces. Seeking reconciliation is not her nature.</p>
<p>Glory! Sean called and got to talk to some of the family! It is worth so much. Also Mary Pat got to laugh and laugh playing Perquacky with her 4 sisters.</p>
<p>I spent some quiet time with Gini. I was reading and she was doing her crossword puzzles. We exchanged a few times. Always light. Always caring. Nice.</p>
<p>Howy stretched into politics. Did I lure him on? He made the statement about limiting Democrats voting by gerrymandering and restrictions on voting didn't affect the outcome of an election just let me to lose it. I said, &quot;That is nonsense. But if you want to believe it it's ok.&quot;</p>
