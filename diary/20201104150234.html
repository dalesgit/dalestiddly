<ul>
<li>[[2020-11-01]] 2020-11-01 How Sean controls our days</li>
<li>[[2020-10-12]] 2020-10-12 My fear of being petty in my irritation with Sean: lounging without his shirt, childish manners</li>
<li>[[2020-10-14]] 2020-10-14 Walking from Kia, wrote a response to Mary Pat. Where’s that?</li>
<li>[[2020-10-15]] 2020-10-15 Confronting notion of co-dependency, elephant in the room, Mary Pat saying, “Well, I guess Sean and I will move out.”</li>
<li>[[2020-10-16]] 2020-10-16 Kind of poem, I want to let go of resentment, sense of being sent out on my own, – cf. the conclusion to my session with Erin where my goal is to find my own space, take care of self, – cf. with that the phrase I used at last session with Linda: “my place in the universe / cosmos”</li>
<li>[[2020-10-17]] 2020-10-17 Reflection on the “fucking liar”, upcoming Hawai’i convention and exposure to my “place in the Episcopal church”</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems from the above that part of my journey with “place in the universe” is about: vocation, faith situation, feeling more Jewish than Christian, retirement?,</p>
<ul>
<li>[[2020-10-22]] 2020-10-22 account of the “shave your head” – leading to new awareness of the <strong>gulf</strong> between us – the <strong>gulf</strong> is the new development I think. No longer Sean so much as Mary Pat and me</li>
<li>[[2020-10-25]] 2020-10-25 Cooking and sewing rising up in my awareness. A part of the process of real change going on in me – adding <strong>exercise</strong>…</li>
<li>[[2020-10-26]] 2020-10-26 Mary Pat hesitant to acknowledge my pain at wanting to “go home” – which is to say not here,</li>
<li>[[2020-10-29]] 2020-10-29 List of some of the irritants, my sense of being left out, minimized, not room for 3 in the kitch. Can’t go back to Hawai’i.</li>
