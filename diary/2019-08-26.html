<h1 id="Yesterday">Yesterday</h1>
<p>I was a real poop on the way to the party at Bob's and at the party itself. Driving, I passed my phone to MP, expecting her to tell me which of the choices I had for River on her birthday she liked. Instead she imagined I was asking her to make the purchase, which she ultimately did, on my phone, that was not well set up for making the purchase.</p>
<p>Later at Bob's house she said I ought to get in touch with Miriam to see if she was going to be there to receive the package. Miriam finally responded saying that they were at Ring Lake Ranch. While waiting for that MP said I needed to reschedule the package if possible. That meant canceling the order. I ended up sending Miriam a message that I would resend the package when she let me know when they would be home.</p>
<p>I imagine there are hurt feelings all around.</p>
<p>Then, I want to reflect a little on how depressing the party felt to me. I just don't know why. I think first of all, of course, about the changes in me. I'm not going back to teaching. I've been struggling with the retirement thing. But with some reflection I think there's more to it. Late in the party I learned that Kirsten Heider is pregnant again. They are expecting their 4th in 5 years. It felt depressing to me. Driving back I said to MP that &quot;the news did not feel celebratory to me.&quot; I couldn't encompass all the feelings. But I felt anger at Kevin for inflicting that on Kristen. I felt alienation from the sense that it was a right-wing Catholic acting too much &quot;in your face.&quot;</p>
<p>The one thought I had throughout sitting on the lanai next to the pool, watching the energy of all the young &quot;next generation&quot;, playing in the pool with their new-fashioned &quot;swimmies&quot;, that I was bewildered and somehow lost with trying to grasp what kind of world those little ones will grow up into. I felt bewildered at the mentality and inner-life of the parents of the babies, wondering what their expectation of the future of the planet and our country was.</p>
<p>Finally, I think I felt depressed (anger?) about the fact that I am cut off from the life of my grandchildren. My choices, many of them. Today's reality in some ways. The reality that families tend to be defined by the mother. In Lydia's case I think maybe Mama Sue and Didi -- to use her childhood names for them.</p>
