<h1 id="Dream">Dream</h1>
<p>Dream that seemed to go on and on before I woke just before my alarm. It was a church setting. There were new policies, a new vision, being implemented. It had to do with being an inclusive church. Clearly they were successful, but there still seemed to be a challenge at the core. There were two parts to the new policies, one part a radical statement and the second a kind of enumeration of specific situations.</p>
<p>Perhaps I was influenced by the <em>New Amsterdam</em> episode we watched last night where the couple had a child who received a heart transplant. As a family they were unable to afford the tremendous cost of the medications he needed to take to keep from rejecting the new heart. The solution the hospital found was to get a divorce (on paper) and the mother and the child would go on medicare so that the government would pay for the meds. The family objected because they were strict catholics.</p>
<p>Also an influence on the dream was our anticipated visit with the St. Paul's, Monroe this morning. Old friends. Good people. But Kathleen is a follower of Pope Benedict.</p>
<p>Also, it seemed that in my dream I (we?) had young children. There was a kind of camping experience going on. The youngest child seemed to be someone like Julian. Bill talked about seeing Julian as well as Owen on their trip to Colorado. They are leaving today to drive home. Bill seemed possibly interested in flying out here for a visit and then to perhaps Williamsburg.</p>

<p>Henry sat behind us. At one point he whispered to Mary Pat that it was like sitting behind []{#rock stars}<strong>rock stars</strong>. That's the way she was waving at people for the first 20 minutes. So many people wanted to touch us. The greeting from many was warm beyond anything I have really ever known.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Becker family. We sat in their family row</li>
<li>Jane Beamer greeted me</li>
<li>Mary Kay Brown greeted me</li>
<li>Venable Burwell greeted</li>
<li>Nicci from choir greeted -- maybe not?</li>
<li>Ronald Cutler was behind the counter in kitchen telling of how the sermon had summoned him to go invite the lost person he might know to come home</li>
<li>Mari didn't remember us -- me only the pony tail, maybe. Her daughter was exuberant.</li>
<li>Lee Cutler was warm. It might have been he behind the kitchen counter</li>
<li>Frank Gaertner was repeated in his warm greetings</li>
<li>Gail &amp; Robert Heath were warm in talking to me, in spite of her difficulties. His big smile in the choir.</li>
<li>Henry &amp; Charlotte Jenkins</li>
<li>Jerry Jones is the priest from Belize. He greeted me. His new wife is Betty -- a Presbyterian?</li>
<li>Gary &amp; Nancy Noles were classic southern church warm in greeting me</li>
<li>Kevin &amp; Melinda Plue were -- both -- warm in greeting</li>
<li>Kathleen warm and I told her very special her music was for me</li>
<li>Ben Roscrow greeted with warmth</li>
<li>Scott &amp; Kim Rushing were in front of us. She said to Mary Pat that as soon as we show up the spirit cuts loose. Apparently the whole summer attendance has been very low. She and her daughters are associated with the most wonderful memories I have of St. Paul's. One of my sermons captured the attention of the adolescent daughters to the point they talked afterwards about it. One of Holy Week services was a time when she (Kim) stopped hearing voices.</li>
<li>Jimm Wetherbee smiled</li>
<li>Barb &amp; Libby Baker are moving to ?? but they stayed at St. Paul's because they were so welcomed. Barb was the glutton-free or the two. Libby was present today.</li>
<li>The Junior Warden and wife both greeting us fondly</li>
<li>Chris &amp; Christine Flack were serving. Chris apparently has multiple health issues.</li>
<li>Jo Singer is letting her hair become naturally grey</li>
</ul>
<p>8:00 we missed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pat &amp; Don Ambrose</li>
<li>Debbie &amp; John Ashcraft</li>
