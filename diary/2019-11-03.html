<ul>
<li>What surprised me today? The satisfaction of walking the trail Julian and I had traveled before.</li>
<li>What inspired me today? That Julian was appreciative of my cooking dinner. The number of times I have been able to truly profit from his insights. Like the other day when observing the frustrations of MP's sisters different styles of dealing with death and he said, &quot;My experience tells me that everyone processes death differently.&quot; Implying be patient with them.</li>
<li>What touched me today? Time with Julian. I love him so. I worry about being the lonely, needy parent. But he has been just great. I thought at one point that this might be the last time I have to spend this kind of time with any of my children.</li>
<li>What did I enjoy doing today? Cooking.</li>
<li>What would I like to more of? The intimacy and deep family connections with Julian.</li>
<li>What would I like to do less of? I need more down time, more alone time. I feel overwhelmed with what feels like having to be &quot;on&quot; constantly.</li>
<li>What did I learn today? I have regularly talked with Julian about all kind of times that I []{#made a connection}<strong>made a connection</strong> or []{#learned something}<strong>learned something</strong>. It's at the heart of things. I told him of the question to lead of RELG 101: &quot;How would you study religion in (e.g.) Rock Hill?</li>
<li>What will I do differently tomorrow? I won't have to struggle with the physical pace that he can muster. Several times he has talked about how his life changed &quot;post-hospital time&quot;. It was after almost dying that he began to eat healthy, quit smoking/drinking, began to inject more positives into his life. He things of the present time -- and the money from my Mom -- as the opportunity to kick start a business and something he can call his own. Oh, I so want that for him.</li>
<li>I have offered to pay for his visit to a dentist. He acknowledges that he needs it. He has no insurance.</li>
<li>Todo: send hin <em>Funny Papers</em> -- he seemed to enjoy reading all the issues I have.</li>

<p>WHEN HENRY JAMES, of all people, was saying goodbye once to his young nephew Billy, his brother William's son, he said something that the boy never forgot. And of all the labyrinthine and impenetrably subtle things that that most labyrinthine and impenetrable old romancer could have said, what he did say was this: &quot;There are three things that are important in human life. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. The third is to be kind.&quot;</p>
