<p>A part of what was generated by the visit to the []{#Carter Center}<strong>Carter Center</strong> today was the following:</p>
<p>&gt; I have for some time identified my feeling that &quot;my country was taken away from me&quot; at the time of the election. It is crystallized with the image of Trump mocking the handicapped person. That was the time that it became acceptable to do that in this country and I am not a part of such a land.</p>
<p>Carter illustrates and indeed illustrated as far back as the 1970's a very different value, culture, principle of leadership and of being a country. It was based on breaking with the past of racism. It was based on strength in high principles more than <span id="machismo"></span><strong>machismo</strong>. It was based on (cf.Â Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel) peace. It was &quot;fair and open elections&quot; not the trumped up rigging of elections that are the Republican Party in our land. It is []{#clean water for all}<strong>clean water for all</strong>. It is combating disease for all. And so on it goes.</p>
<p>Today's visit was a reminder and a remembrance of a time when our nation stood for something noble. We are now a second rate nation whose goals are self-preservation and the rest of the world be damned.</p>
