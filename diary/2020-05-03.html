<h1 id="memories-of-hawaii-memories-of-hawaii">Memories of Hawai'i {#Memories of Hawai’i}</h1>
<p>Sun May 03, 2020 07:11 AM</p>
<p>I wake early and feel a deep discouragement. I woke with dreamy images of Hawai'i. I had been looking at St. Mary's Centennial photos on my phone. Mary Pat had conjured memories by talking to Eugenia on the phone yesterday. She talked about their new priest. Eugenia had shared with him that I had earlier arrived just before 9/11. The new guy arrived March 23rd -- Corona Virus exploding on the scene.</p>
<p>I feel like I haven't really accomplished anything. That I don't have anything to offer. Some of it stems from grading my final. My rubric didn't help -- it was a fuck up on my part. I somehow screwed up the vocabulary matching questions -- all the answers lined up. I listen to the lectures on Introduction to Religious Studies and the guy, who is not much younger than I, is so masterful in surveying the major thinkers. He finds quick ways to summarize the likes of Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim.</p>
<h1 id="walk-and-writing-idea-walk-and-writing-idea">Walk and writing idea {#Walk and writing idea}</h1>
<ul>
<li>watched part of livestream from St. Mary's. I was critical of the talking head.</li>
<li>We prayed morning prayer with St. Paul's. Sort of designed by me. More edifying than Fr. Browning's.</li>
<li>Fr. Browning crosses himself in the Orthodox fashion. No candles on his altar.</li>
<li>Because of the photo display and Eugenia I have been looking at images that are nostalgic. Call to mind memories. Helpful …</li>
<li>Walking I listened to rest of Max Weber. I was taken back to college days when the insights of <em>Protestant Ethic …</em> called out to me as a began to discover an alternative to the American Spirit.</li>
<li>Poem: I re-listened to 2 Padraig's musings. One on the Irish poet who re-discovered who his voice, the colors, the living …. The other the Australian who demands the telling and re-telling of the story, of the massacre mob, whether it feels good or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>And somehow I landed on the notion of writing down a memory for Lydia and Emma -- starting with Emma, I think. She is the one who is most obviously lost to me. Like all the people in the Australian poets family and people. People lost, but we must tell the story.</p>
<p>Whether it's long or short, it could be a document I could bequeath to the girls. Would I continue it onward (or backward) to the children who still talk to me? Perhaps so.</p>
<p>My voice? It was clear to me at a certain point trying to watch the live stream of St. Mary's that I am enormously glad that I'm not there now. +Bob's leadership is a terrible thing. Religious minded lawyers do well there, I guess. St. Mary's hasn't moved very far along a path from when I left 8 years ago. Perhaps a young person will make it happen. His Southern Baptist / Orthodox spirit, combined with youthful energy.</p>
<p>But I did what I could do. I needed to move. And I couldn't move with Bridget. Chaminade was a place that could have been good for the girls. Teaching has been a good place in the twilight of my life and career. Mary Pat has been someone who loves me and allows me to love her.</p>
