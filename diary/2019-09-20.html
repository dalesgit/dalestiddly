<h1 id="Yesterday">Yesterday</h1>
<p>Bible study at WELCM was a satisfying experience. Jameson is a young adult beginning her spiritual journey. She shows such vulnerability, curiosity, courage. Olga-Maria also was very revealing. All of it from the parable of the &quot;unjust steward,&quot; a perplexing parable.</p>
<p>One of the keys to the story is that there is no clean demarkation between the ending of the story -- where there is a &quot;master&quot; -- and the beginning of Jesus' teaching -- where he is the master.</p>
