<h1 id="the-news-of-the-day">The news of the day</h1>
<p>So it is just sprung on me that Sean has a car (a Cadillac pimp-mobile) and he has a license to drive and he has given notice to Advance Auto that he is going to part-time (15-20 hours?) and that he has received an “LLC” with the intention of going to work for 35 hours at $15-16 per hour with his sponsor Chris, who has some sort of construction company.</p>
<p>All of that has been woven over the last few weeks. It changes a lot, for both MP and myself.</p>
<p>During my walk I realized that her deeply satisfying time in the car – with Sean, but also her time alone, has come to an end.</p>
<p>For me, the interminable time with Sean seems closer to ending than I had allowed myself to imagine.</p>
<p>All the time that MP didn’t share vital information from me. I have known for some time that my role was simply to be informed of things after the fact. She, for her part, makes the excuse that it was difficult to talk to me. It was.</p>
<p>Her measure of time is the last year or so when she sees the marriage entering difficult times. Claiming that Sean’s arrival was only a catalyst. For me, Sean’s arrival (+ 30 days or so) was the beginning of the most unhappy time of my life for many years. She continues to claim that I said that she is to blame for that. I told her, yet again, that I did not say that and I told her so immediately after her first rendition. The counselor who heard me refused to back me up. Ah, well.</p>
