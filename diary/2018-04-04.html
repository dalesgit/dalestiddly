<p>It is after midnight. I don't know why I am still awake. The readings for tonight from Northumbria strike close to home. Deep. but I am too inebriated to make much of it. The wealth of my possible writing are contained there if I could go back and pursue it.</p>
<p>Watching <em>The Big Lebowski</em> last night. It's absurdity and comic play was really very delightful. The pop treatment of it has apparently turned it into a kind of American Zen or Taoist paean. I don't know about that. But it has very few moments that aren't somehow spot on. Video dream sequence of floating through a tunnel of women's legs to strike the pins of a bowling alley. Experiencing the paranoia of being chased by bad guys by imagining himself as tiny with a bowling ball rolling his direction ready to crush him. He hides in one of the finger holes and the camera then rolls down the alley toward the pins -- rolling over and over.</p>

<p>Mary Pat thinks of _Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya-Sisterhood as we were talking about the time that Mom went away because of &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;. That's as we received it somehow. Bill doesn't remember it. Context was that Dad was still around because I somehow knew that he orchestrated it. I always attributed it to drinking. But Bill is keenly aware of how Mom blamed Dad for not treating David's pyloricstenosis. Might Mom have been suffering from post-natal depression + anger at Dad. Was there drugs on top of alcohol as in the Ya-Ya story?</p>
<p>Shirley had messaged Bill on Sunday that she thought that it would do Mom good to hear the news about Caroline.</p>
<p>My points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should honor mom and try to honor what she needs to do at this time of her life</li>
<li>Bill remembered something he read or saw about honoring people's <span id="story"></span><strong>story</strong>. And Mom's story hasn't included Caroline. Mom's story included dark secrets that she wanted to take to the grave. Asking, does it do her good to break the news that it's not a secret?</li>
<li>It's possible that asking her to the funeral might be a gesture.</li>
<li>Bill: Mom's life has never focused on children particularly. But Mary Pat observes that her distancing from children could be related to having given away her first born.</li>
</ul>
