<h1 id="dream-on-the-road">Dream on the road</h1>
<p>I was driving with 4-5 children. They were a mixture of mine and someone else’s. Were they neighbors? Or his/hers? I don’t know. It seemed like we were on the west slope of Colorado somehow, somewhere. We had driven there for some reason but we were trying to get home.</p>
<p>(<strong>Same story as I often dream in that regard. But this was a new dream in terms of details</strong>. There were maybe similarities to the dream of the other day when I was walking. Trying to get home.)</p>
<p>We ended up being delayed because the place we were some how holed up in had once been something else but now was a used car dealer. The owner liked the car I was driving and wanted to buy it. I was open. But I wanted to get home, and so I told him that I would need to take the offer to my wife – who was clearly Mary Pat. At the end of the dream we started off down the road, but I was going to have to drive all night. In a car full of young people.</p>
