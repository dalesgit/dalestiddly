<p>Things were tentative from yesterday. Kind of left in limbo. Today went ok until I returned from the errand trip she sent me on. I walked in and started talking about the interview I was listening to on the radio -- with Margaret Atwood about her just released novel. MP said she didn't hear me as I was putting down the groceries. I turned and went back outside to get the 2nd batch of bags. She said to me, &quot;I guess you didn't get my text.&quot; I felt exasperated. I said that she had told me that earlier, but that I had bought a few extra things. She said, &quot;OK&quot; in a tone that seemed to convey to me a kind of weary acceptance. At some point I said it's frustrating hearing the first words that come to me a litany of the things I did wrong. I must have said that with some feeling. Perhaps my voice raised a little. But we were talking to one another in different rooms and she had said that she couldn't hear me.</p>
<p>As I was unpacking the groceries she said something like, &quot;I didn't hear you said.&quot; I repeated in some fashion what I have written, raising my voice by some volume. What feels like &quot;raising my voice&quot; is felt by her to be anger and she reacts very strongly to it.</p>
<p>In the bedroom where she had retreated, I followed her and said in a somewhat raised voice what I had experienced. I said I wasn't angry. She said, &quot;Your voice is angry.&quot; I said it's the same volume as you left me with.</p>
<p>She finished with something to the effect that, &quot;Your anger is too much.&quot; I responded with, &quot;Your passive aggression is too much.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>It does no good trying to psycho-analyze what's going on in her. Been there. Done that.</li>
<li>My anger. I have thought it stemmed from depression and tried several times to convey that to MP. I have never felt that sharing with her was productive. My further assumption has been that MP's volatility and repeated negativity -- toward me and just about everybody else -- was the result of the same thing.</li>
<li>I have regularly felt that she interprets some responses from me as anger when they are not. I've asked myself why is she prone to do that? Sensitivity or fear of anger? But I think that's probably a fruitless conjecture.</li>
<li>I am easily convinced that there's nothing I can do about where she is.</li>
<li>I have felt the need to be in a place where it was OK to be angry, one of the basic emotions. What is abundantly clear to me is that my love for her transcends any of the emotions.</li>
