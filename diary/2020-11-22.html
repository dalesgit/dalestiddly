<p>I was at a carnival kind of space. A Disney-world sort of place. My family was around. I know I saw Julian’s face. Mary Pat may have been there. Familiar images: climbing, water, some kind of tram/train sort of thing. Lots of the character of Hawai’i. And I was trying to get back home. It was closing time.</p>
<p>A sense of well-being because I think I went like 7 hours without getting up to pee.</p>
<p>I thought that I “showed up” with the episode yesterday. I thanked Mary Pat for not leaving. She thanked me for “talking.” I felt offended by that, because I have such a strong conviction that it is she that cuts off conversation. But I suppressed the feeling because my head thinks that it is another version of “He said, she said.” Arguing about who started it, who’s to blame, self-justification, these do not advance the cause.</p>
