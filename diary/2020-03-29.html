<p>Tim Fitzgerald interview. I learned that Locke was the first or in that period &quot;politics&quot; became a thing. Hadn't been a &quot;thing&quot; before. Same period saw the reification of &quot;political economy&quot;, &quot;economics&quot;. He claimed that the rise in 17th-18th c. of &quot;liberalism&quot; was in fact a move to defend the &quot;white men&quot; who had begun buying land. Our whole enterprise in the US is about defending the right of private ownership.</p>
<p>The insight I take from it is that those things that we take for granted leaves us blind. Cf. the lesson about celibacy and the evidence of laws against married clergy. We don't see it until it is pointed out to us.</p>
<p><em>Empty Signs in an Automatic Signalling System</em>. Using words like &quot;religion&quot; and we think we know what they mean. The politics insight caused me to think that the mixture of religion and politics (and all the rest in culture) is in fact the norm. It was in the rise of Locke's &quot;natural rights&quot; of land-owners that it appeared in our tradition. But we have taken it for granted.</p>
<p>Locke, he said, had a stake in the &quot;Africa Company&quot; which was, like the &quot;East India Company&quot;, set up for colonial exploitation. In Africa Company one found especially exploitation of the slave trade.</p>

<p>My thought when I was trying to quickly move through my stack of <em>Time</em> magazines. Not <span id="everything"></span><strong>everything</strong>, of course, but in any particular issue there may be several articles that strike me as important to know. Then later walking and listening to the interview with Timothy Fitzgerald and his talk of &quot;meta-categories&quot;. And I had the sensation that my thinking was going deeper and deeper, and some 4-word phrase would feel impenetrable until it suddenly made sense and the sense connected countless experiences or sensations. And it felt like reading various texts in college, from Wittgenstein to Eliot, then later David Tracy or <em>Simple Justice</em>, John Rawls.</p>

<li>organized the due dates for Winthrop highlights for rest of semester. Found that checkvist is really pretty powerful. The internal hyperlinks is cool.</li>
<li>MP had baked bread for Judge's and we delivered to them. That was good.</li>
<li>MP is agitated by the sickness of Sydney in Atlanta which may be Covid-19. Her dementia means she doesn't know what's going on and Kathy can't see her. She was also worried about Tim, but having called Dennis she got messages from him. She said, &quot;It's not been a good day for me.&quot;</li>
<li>We went for a walk at Cherry Park which I liked. Then I made my regular walk and was inspired to hear Rebecca Solnit and her finding hope in unexpected places.</li>

<p>The Woman that she interviews on writing on the hope observes that we couldn’t see the real effects of the Soviet union breaking apart because the impact of the revolution was felt in Europe and other places where governments took it upon themselves to care more about workers and the poor immigrants and so on.￼</p>
<p>I’m thinking of my experience of not being able to see things that we look at directly as on the horizon.</p>
<p>She quotes her partner who is quoting for Karl something to the effect that we know what we do we know why we do what we do but we don’t know what we do does.</p>
<p>She has done significant research -- written -- about the response of people in times of disaster. Cf. Dorothy Day's formative experience of 1906 earthquake. Her own experience of 1989 earthquake. Katrina.</p>
<p>She finds hope coming from these events. Profound hope that often is surprising and doesn't appear for years or centuries. MLK Jr. influenced Arab Spring. Dubçek in the Prague spring of 1968 then became a leader in the 1989 fall of Soviet Union.</p>
<p>She notes that hope and stories of hope often feature neighbors. When the disaster collapses your house it will be your neighbors who respond.</p>
<hr />
<p>Search on quotes from her:</p>
<p>&gt; “We think we tell stories, but stories often tell us, tell us to love or hate, to see or be seen. Often, too often, stories saddle us, ride us, whip us onward, tell us what to do, and we do it without questioning. The task of learning to be free requires learning to hear them, to question them, to pause and hear silence, to name them, and then become a story-teller.” ― Rebecca Solnit, The Faraway Nearby</p>
<p>&gt; “One of the reasons people lock onto motherhood as a key to feminine identity is the belief that children are the way to fulfill your capacity to love. But there are so many things to love besides one's own offspring, so many things that need love, so much other work love has to do in the world.” ― Rebecca Solnit, The Mother of All Questions</p>
<p>&gt; “Hope just means another world might be possible, not promise, not guaranteed. Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.” ― Rebecca Solnit, Hope in the Dark</p>
<p>&gt; (K. Tippet saying) You describe your childhood in so many ways, and in one place — these are words you use, “A scrawny, battered little kid in a violent house.” And I wonder how you would think about that notion of the spiritual background of your childhood. And it occurs to me that perhaps some of these things were seeded by absence, as much as by presence.</p>
