<h1 id="yesterdays-work-yesterdays-work">Yesterday's work {#Yesterday’s work}</h1>
<ul>
<li>Drove to and fro Monroe</li>
<li>Mass and interactions, including sermon, seemed good, but not flashy.</li>
<li>Later Kathleen sent an email of thanks, very kind.</li>
<li>Successfully downloaded my Google Play Music library -- though frustratingly with duplicates. Now I have to get a new large backup hard-drive. The last one has been full for a long time.</li>
<li>watched <em>3 Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri</em> It agonizingly chronicles the effect of one woman's unleashed anger and guilt. Then we watched <em>Scandal</em>. Both films depict the blending of good and evil -- flawed humanity. <em>Scandal</em> episode portrayed Olivia as a kind of American hero in the form of many other spy warriors. She was imprisoned in a strange, violent, place.</li>
<li>My dreams seem particularly vivid. But they're not revelatory. Like a rehearsal of familiar themes.</li>
<li>My work in the church seems a little like that. Learned the other day that Jeff Lee is retiring in Chicago. The world is passing us by.</li>
<li>Today is Easter. It is as if it's difficult to tell the difference between dreaming and, pinch me, the waking world.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Today">Today</h1>
<ul>
<li>Watched St. Paul's</li>
<li>listened to Bp. Curry</li>
<li>started watching Max von Sydow</li>
<li>Talked Gary</li>
<li>talked Joe: shared my story of 2 x's looking in mirror startled that I wasn't Japanese. Zach is marrying Keiko. Mother Japanese nissei. Father issei.</li>
