<h1 id="meet-with-peter-meet-with-peter">Meet with Peter {#Meet with Peter}</h1>
<p>A most wonderful dinner last night with Christina and Peter. They made it in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe, our 7th anniversary, my 37th anniversary of ordination. Christina and I connected over sewing, then memories of their kids and her projects over the years. Fabulous.</p>
<p>Then Peter asked about whether I wanted to teach next year -- i.e.Â 2020-21. Oh my. The trouble is that with Sean expected to be with us it might be a good idea.</p>
<p>Met with him this morning</p>
<p>Watched tonight <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild</em>. An utterly one of a kind movie that successfully portrayed <span id="metaphor"></span><strong>metaphor</strong> (glaciers melting, wildebeest like animals tramping across the landscape portending doom). Father and daughter portraying the violence and the deep love of folks living off the grid on an island forgotten in a Louisiana bay.</p>
<h1 id="preaching-advent-4-preaching-advent-4">Preaching Advent 4 {#Preaching Advent 4}</h1>
<p>Is this applicable for preaching on Advent 4? Cosmic ordering. Small packages.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an order to the universe, even if I am too stupid to see it&quot; from the author -- or &quot;Hushpuppy&quot; might say she was too little to see the big picture, but she trusts in it. An unbelievably powerful performance by a 5 year old. Not far behind is the father actor who is a first time performer, formerly a cafe owner.</p>
