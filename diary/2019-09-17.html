<p>Yesterday a long day of appointments and todos. My appointment with Dr.Â Weber went on for quite a while (I had to wait a while too) was emotionally kind of tugging for me. My liver numbers didn't go down. They continued up for the 2nd time in a row. We're going to cut out statin all together. Focus on diet and supplements for the cholesterol -- which didn't go up that much for cutting the statin in half. Now it will be a half more. The most obvious change needs to be to cut back on alcohol.</p>
<p>I also raised &quot;erectile dysfunction&quot; at the encouragement of MP. I did, but in the waiting room I looked up more information than the doctor could give me. Drugs that interfere with &quot;ED&quot; include:</p>
<ul>
<li>metroprolol</li>
<li>antihistamines</li>
<li>Zantac (ranitidine)</li>
</ul>
<p>Later dinner with Sue. At one point MP realized that I was irritated that she wasn't letting me speak. At the end of dinner, Sue asked if we wanted to retire to the lanai for after dinner drinks. She quickly said, &quot;Yes&quot; in a buoyant voice. Then she recognized that I was frowning and wanted to go home. She went along with it. But it's hard for me because in both cases I wanted to please her. But she really needed to relent in both cases.</p>
<p>The highlight of the evening was being able to say something that sparked a grace moment for Sue. She does an &quot;examen&quot; every day, but focuses on all the ways she has fallen short. Influence of old Jesuits at Marquette? I asked her about adding the question, &quot;What gave you joy in the day?&quot; and variations. I said that's where the Jesuits are today. Google it. She seemed genuinely moved.</p>
<h1 id="Examen">Examen</h1>
<p>Important elements of the day for me were:</p>
<ul>
<li>becoming conscious of the life-style changes needed</li>
<li>hope for dealing with &quot;ED&quot;</li>
<li>being able to minister</li>
<li>recognizing how much the church has moved past me -- my seminary days were 40 years ago!</li>
<li>getting &quot;conky&quot; to work quickly on my linux/chromebox</li>
</ul>
