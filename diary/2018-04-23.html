<p>= Passport dream (Julian too)= <a href="diary/2018-05-21.html">Julian has these dreams too</a> Dream this morning included a standard-issue &quot;trying to get ready for passport travel&quot; dream. Nothing seemed exceptional about it. The smooth sleeping / dreaming happened after I got up and finally took an ibuprofen.</p>
<p>Yesterday at St.Â Paul's there were a number of quite emotional expressions of deep appreciation for me / us and our ministry there. In Mary Pat's efforts to understand &quot;rector time certain&quot; -- which I was claiming was an oxymoron -- she discovered the practice in moving from an &quot;interim&quot; to a &quot;rector time certain&quot;. Apparently there is often an emotional bond forged with the interim and some amount of time (weeks or months) is scheduled between the two to allow the congregation to leave off the old before starting the new.</p>
<p>It may well be that Julius has been instructed to do that with us.</p>
<p>I am struck however about how I don't feel transparency coming from either Julius or this new anonymous &quot;rector time certain&quot; who hadn't shared his search with his senior warden or parish.</p>
