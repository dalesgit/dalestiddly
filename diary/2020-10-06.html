<h1 id="dreaming-about-grading">Dreaming about grading</h1>
<p>20201006093804 I spent the night tossing and turning and thinking about rubrics and the raft of grades I have to get through in my class. The last thing I looked at was the long list, checking to see how many had turned in the <em>Siddhartha</em> paper. 50 out of ca. 60 now.</p>
<p>Mary Pat had come to bed to read with me. She has made a determined effort to pay attention to me. It has been a little bit jarring, because it’s such a shift from the last few months.</p>
<p>My goal was to take care of myself, cultivate my space. So for me the important thing was that I said, “I don’t want to watch tv.” She joined me after spending a little bit of time with Sean.</p>
