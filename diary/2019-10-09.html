<p>= Everglades and the destruction of the US=</p>
<p>This morning we leave for a full day tour. I'm exited. I'm wondering how much of the Everglades are left from its origins.</p>
<p>I'm wondering how Republicans can defend the actions of the criminal we have in office. It seems to me a measure of how far down we've come as a nation and society.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are not a good people</li>
<li>It is not a good place to live</li>
<li>as a nation we are selfish and ignorant</li>
<li>as a nation we are violent and don't care for our neighbors</li>
<li>We were heroes once upon a time, but no longer</li>
<li>The lawyers in Voldemort's regime plot how they would have defended Nixon -- as though he were defendable</li>
<li>The complicity of Republicans today is compared to the complicity of Republicans in the McArthy era -- we are so far away from that innocent time.</li>
</ul>
