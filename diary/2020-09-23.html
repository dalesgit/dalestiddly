<p>Our life has utterly changed since S arrival. MP shops with him. Talks with him. Doesn’t talk with me. Spends up to 4 hours a day driving him to where he needs to be. He decides how the table is set. He was the first to use the vacuum. He was the first to use the washing machine. He decides my part of the grocery list. He goes to the hardware store for me. He takes it on himself that doing dishes and taking the trash are his jobs. He decides that we have to look at his ½ naked body when he is in our presence. He pontificates his wisdom.</p>
<p>Like the tragic star of “A Star is Born” Sean has it all together. He knows.</p>
<p>Sean has no “skin in the game.” He trashes a pan MP has had for 20 years. He doesn’t know about it. She doesn’t care. He is given:</p>
<ul>
<li>room</li>
<li>board</li>
<li>health ins</li>
<li>dental work</li>
<li>as much food as he wants</li>
<li>comfortable house</li>
<li>media consumption</li>
<li>driven to work</li>
<li>driven to meetings</li>
<li>no need for car insurance</li>
</ul>
<p>His exit strategy is, “Someday I want to have my own business. In 9 months, maybe, I will have a drivers’ license and I can buy a car and drive myself.”</p>
<h1 id="the-point">The point</h1>
<p>I have lost hope. I said last night in the brief conversation with MP that I saw <strong>no way out</strong>. Like Becket’s “No exit”. Like trapped. Stuck in: US, SC, Rock Hill, living with Sean until I die, gone the church work, gone church connection (more Jewish than Christian?) Gone teaching.</p>
<p>So, some of it is retirement. Some of it is getting old. Some of it is being stuck in a shit-hole country and state. Some of it is longing for mountains and ocean.</p>
<p>What is the Sean part? He disgusts me. What to do about that?</p>
