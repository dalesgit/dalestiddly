<p>Tue Jul 07, 2020 12:46 AM</p>
<p>I told him about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scott telling me about &quot;FINE&quot;. Sean observing the significance of acronyms referred to one that evoked fight or flight impulse. It was FEAR: fuck everything and run.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Scott telling me that he had survived one relapse but he couldn't survive another</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Hearing 2 voices: 1 my father telling me that he was OK and it was going to be okay. The other was in Sacred Heart Chapel (Basilica) when not knowing what to do I heard: &quot;I don't care what you do as long as you love me with your whole heart, your soul, your body, and your mind.&quot; (or was it &quot;strength&quot; -- I've forgotten.)</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>the prisoner at Michigan Penitentiary -- I would entrust my two girls to him. The most adverse circumstances, when responded to with the right attitude and behaviors, produces an astonishing transformation.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>he talked about how the therapists had taught him about cognitive therapy. That there was event, emotions and feelings, action. That if you want a different result from your past you have to interfere with that sequence.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The conversation began with passing a church named &quot;Shekinah&quot;. I explained it meant the &quot;<span id="presence"></span><strong>presence</strong>&quot; of God. I asked him if he had experienced something like that. He thought for a moment and then said that one time was his decision to go to Halawa. That the pieces he could identify argued that going to a treatment center was the best immediate choice. But he somehow knew that the difficult decision was the best one for him. God's voice telling him.</li>
</ul>
