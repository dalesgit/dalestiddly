<p>The seven &quot;Oh&quot;.</p>
<p>70 is a big number but it's not quite prime. Ah, there's more. It's a round number that isn't thereby hip. Looked at from below, it is a scary number. But quite tame from the vantage of, say, 75 or 80.</p>
<p>By age 70 one doesn't hold a lot of stock in birthdays, But your mother would scoff at thinking it old at all. The age one *<span id="is"></span><strong>is</strong>* and the age one *<span id="feels"></span><strong>feels</strong>* are not the same. Just See me when I totter out of bed at night.</p>
<p>70 gives us lots of space to flow in and out, Like the clouds flowing past a hot-air balloon; Experience undergirding our presence, While wonder carries us deeper than Crater Lake.</p>
<p>Our children have reached an age that seemed out of reach When we were young. Wisdom remains as elusive as then. I would love to own the rhythm to dance the liturgy, But your arm in mine is sufficient for ever and always.</p>
<p>That hat I gave you as you gave me a flapper-smile, lit your face and smote my heart And never more shall I not love you or Stanch the pull of just to look you in the eyes.</p>
<p>What? you ask. Just to see you is my satisfaction. We make a dance to the melody of life, in a two-step shuffle Or just arm in arm, doing our best. &quot;On the lips&quot;, you tell me, pointer finger on your mouth.</p>
