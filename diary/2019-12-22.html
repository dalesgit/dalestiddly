<p>Yesterday MP made a comment after the evening with Barb and Sue. It was a satisfying time for her, I think. Her only Christmas party. So it was important. And increasingly it has seemed that it was important that she had a friend, even if it's Barb Belle.</p>
<p>But MP commented that evidently it was I who didn't like the idea of <span id="retirement"></span><strong>retirement</strong> since it was I who was increasingly committed to things. It seems like it's a true statement about me. Pay attention? Also, however, after Monroe it will be different.</p>

<p>Charlotte &amp; Susan (senior wardens) have talked about not wanting the congregation to perceive me as a &quot;supply&quot; priest, but rather as a kind of &quot;interim&quot; pastor. Oh my!</p>
<p>Met a Muslim couple, Syrian refugees, who came to church. They have no Muslim community. Connect them with Duha and her community.</p>

<p>At breakfast I described for someone what my goals in my class at WU were. I emphasized the awareness of Children of Abraham I think applies to all Christians. Then, amazingly there was a Muslim couple at 10:30 mass. When I asked them they repeated twice that they found it <span id="interesting"></span><strong>interesting</strong>. I still don't understand why they came, but my hunch is that they were looking for community. I talked a long time in the gathering room. I agreed to reach out to Duha's group to see if they might reach out to the couple. They are Syrian refugees. He's been here 5 years, she 6 months.</p>
