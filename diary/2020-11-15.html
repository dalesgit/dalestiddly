<h1 id="dream-on-the-beach">Dream on the beach</h1>
<p>Last dream of the night I was on a small island. There was a “we” of uncertain identity. My sense is that Mary Pat was not with the small group of us but that she wasn’t far away. There seemed to be young people in the group. Perhaps the dream was prompted by the photo I saw yesterday for the first time that seemed to show Tim &amp; Sue Vail together with Bridget and the two girls with their beaus, riding in two vehicles along a beach somewhere.</p>
<p>The photo was clearly not tropical, however. The group of us in the dream were waiting for a sort of clam back, some sort of sea food broil, on the beach.</p>
<p>I don’t think I was trying to make a long trip somewhere, like so many of my dreams. Trying to get home from a far away place. I was in an extension of “home” but not actually home to the place I slept at nights.</p>
<p>Then I woke, deciding to pee. It was only the 2nd time of the and it felt good not waking every 1½ hours. But it meant that I was going to have to get up without even a full 6 hours of sleep. Mary Pat’s alarm would go off in a few minutes, I couldn’t fall back asleep. So here I am.</p>
<p>And I wonder about how putting these few words together, forming sentences, fashioning the meaning on the page to correspond in some sense with the narrative inside of me, trying to locate the meanings that have some significance, these things give me joy.</p>
<p>Not less, I suppose, than sewing the place mats that Mary Pat finished needle pointing over 20 years ago. Than a small bag I’d like to make to hold my sunglasses.</p>
<h1 id="ignorance-and-misinformation-about-the-holocaust">Ignorance and misinformation about the holocaust</h1>
<p>After watching the movie <em>Seventh Cross</em> (1944), Mary Pat googled the question. She read aloud startling data and surveys that show a stunning lack of awareness and even great inclination to believe misinformation in the US. She seemed surprised by the information that “some countries have made it illegal” to teach or proclaim a denial of the holocaust. In the US, she reported, some of the states that don’t mandate education on Holocaust have populations with a higher awareness of the truth than in other states, like South Carolina, Texas, Florida, that do require teaching about the holocaust.</p>
<p>I’m interested in the whole misinformation thing, the abandonment of belief in “truth”, the question of whether or not it’s true that denying false information gives rise to a greater conviction of the mis-information – this I have repeated after hearing a story on HIV/AIDS in the early 2000’s while driving on Kalanianaole HWY.</p>
<p>Yesterday I listened to the last (32nd) lecture by Philip Carey I think his name is, from Eastern Pennsylvania Univ., on Philosophy and Religion. He made it much clearer his own position as a protestant reformed trained theologian. He spoke of George Lindbeck in the same lecture as some Reformed philosophers, crafting an alternative post-modern epistemology. His protestant background left me cold, but he did prompt a lot of reflection on “truth and knowledge”. His summary of Lindbeck seemed warmly familiar to me, sounding a kinship with anthropology as I, too, have understood for many years. Carey felt a much greater alignment with “history” and it felt so <strong>tired</strong>to me.</p>
<p>But that’s the background for the bewildering abandonment of trust and belief in truth that now plagues our society. In part it is the transformation that has happened in our students, as our educational system for 2 generations or more has emphasized diversity, together with an awareness of how different are the experiences (inner at least) of people from different backgrounds and cultures. What the take-away is, though, of these students, getting a shallow understanding, is a belief in the relativity of truth. It is whatever an individual believes it to be. That is no truth at all.</p>
<p>This dynamic seems to have been at work with the Trump public not understanding the process of counting votes in Pennsylvania this just past election. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
