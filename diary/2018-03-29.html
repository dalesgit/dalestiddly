<p>He wanted to check out his thinking with regard to medical decisions. The cardiologist proposes draining Mom's lungs. The goal would be to try to discover why it's there and why it won't go away. The nurse or someone wondered whether that's what we wanted done since Bill had asked about hospice.</p>
<p>At first Bill said no as being an invasive procedure. But after looking it up and talking to Karla, we are agreed that it is not really very invasive. Has some promise of improving her quality of life. And she had said <span id="yes"></span><strong>yes</strong> to oxygen but <span id="no"></span><strong>no</strong> to food back in December.</p>
<p>The way I process that decision, admittedly made in a groggy condition, is that Mom was able to distinguish between those 2 procedures.</p>
