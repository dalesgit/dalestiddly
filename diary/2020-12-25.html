<h1 id="yesterday-at-great-falls">Yesterday at Great Falls</h1>
<p>It was the end of an era. First time Speedy was not at a service. It ended up being just Cindy and Hank, who had together gone to a great deal of trouble to make the church suitable for worship. The last recorded service had been March 1. Outwardly, by the usual standards (count) it was sad.</p>
<p>But it was so beautiful. The music and contemplative atmosphere we sustained for an hour was the best ever for me at that place. That it was two siblings brought together for their rapidly declining parents was focused and they were receptive. My message was that we are especially aware of our great need right now, the need for which the Incarnation was the response. They both were aware. My words were somehow just right.</p>
<p>Cindy has been in Greenville since Thanksgiving and will be staying through December, away from her family. Hank is off work for a few weeks, carrying the burden of Great Falls, perhaps estranged from his wife, the immediate person watching his world fade away.</p>
<p>I was really glad to have been there.</p>
<p>Mary Pat had prepared a fondue supper for us. Especially Sean was the touchstone for her, but it was appropriate for me as well, or perhaps my heart was a little softened or just especially flexible for Christmas.</p>
