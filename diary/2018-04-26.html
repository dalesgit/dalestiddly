<p>I feel so much venom towards Miriam. I feel it in the effort to evaluate how I feel about the possibility of breaking off a relationship with her over her cultivating a separate relationship with Bridget and with Emmma.</p>
<p>I feel conflicted about that. But I feel equally adamant about the point I said to her that our intentions don't always have the effect that we want. That there are &quot;[]{#unintended consequences.}<strong>unintended consequences.</strong>&quot; I am content at the moment to rest with that conviction.</p>
<p>Who has won? At one level I am just protecting myself and my primary relationships. I can't continue to walk into a 2-faced relationship with a naive expectation.</p>

<p>I wake up an all I can think about is Bob Fitzpatrick. The trigger or association is the email yesterday about upcoming ordinations. Long list, 6-7 maybe. Bob has really impacted the diocese of Hawai'i. Maybe he's solved the problems and challenges. Maybe my anger is simply resentment that I couldn't be a part of the solution. That I was cast aside as an impediment to Bob having his will. i.e. e.g. he saw major problems with the []{#Total Ministry}<strong>Total Ministry</strong> solution. He had a better way. But the ones he has chosen that I knew had real problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Malcolm. Had a scandalous lack of knowledge about the Old Testament and didn't appreciate that it was a gap. He carried a 30 year chip on his shoulder, nurtured by a cadre of followers from around the globe, wanting to see movement supporting indigenous peoples. I couldn't fathom the sense I got from him and others that the world had to conform to his notion. Bob turned out to be the same way. A terrible listener.</li>
<li>Paul Lucas. He came before the Standing Committee at an early stage. But I had never encountered anyone so consumed with rage and a sense of his own self-righteousness.</li>
<li>Then there was the early response from the priest on Molokai. She needed to go. It was a knotty problem. But her testimony was that Bob was a liar. I dismissed the idea. But it turns out that Bob is a liar.</li>
<li>Bill Mok accused Greg of being a liar. I took umbrage. And yet I think that in that case Bill was right.</li>
</ul>
<p>The point here, being that I need to recognize the depth of anger within me. Do I want to take it to the grave? I think that Liz Z. maybe carries that kind of anger. So many rectors Bob forced out, punishing the congregation along the way.</p>

<p>What makes sense to me, finally, tonight. That I should get down to Las Cruces next week. Maybe see Julian. But primarily because it makes sense to be there when Bill &amp; Karla are there -- whether or not Mom is still alive. I told Bill that I don't need to be there for me viz a viz Mom. However, I recognize that normally the time of death is a sacred time and it's an honor to share with someone. He acknowledges that he's not so good with the <span id="sacred"></span><strong>sacred</strong> thing, but that he thinks I was serving Mom in that regard even when I was there in Dec/Jan.</p>
<p>Earlier today he talked with the person who is filling in for Nick until the interim priest gets there -- the retired bishop of Northern California, Jerry Lamb. He prayed with mom and asked Bill what he could do. Bill just said that was the right thing.</p>
<p>Karla was aware of her Dad turning purple and Mom has purple splotches. Oh, predicting when death will arrive is such a tricky business. Bp. Lamb knows that I want to be involved in the funeral and he agreed that he might be helpful in that regard.</p>
<p>Bill says she's &quot;mostly non-responsive&quot;. Some response to pain, he said, she had a sentence kind of message about it. Karla disputed that she really spoke. But Bill said that she <span id="mouthed"></span><strong>mouthed</strong> &quot;I love you.&quot; I told him that was a message intended for him. He agreed but tried to say that I was important to Mom also. We can all agree on that.</p>
<p>Bill says that they would want the funeral by the 19th if she dies relatively soon. They are thinking that they will be stay through next week, but then have to be back in Flagstaff the following week.</p>
<p>David is not coming before a funeral. He has messaged Paul/Shirley that she was in hospice (as of Wednesday).</p>
<p>n.b. could Ken Gilliken be a help at Our Saviour? Diocesan policy re. ELCA?</p>
<h2 id="mom-left-mom-left">Mom left {#Mom left}</h2>
<p>I didn't know until the morning. But after midnight he sent a text that Mom had died somewhere around 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Now we have come full-circle. George left. Helen left.</p>
