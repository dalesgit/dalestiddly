<p>Susan,</p>
<p>Thank you for the update on your schedule. It sounds a little bit hectic and crazy. One of my thoughts was your good fortune, certainly blessing, that you have so much family centered around Madison. Perhaps the most poignant thing you said was wondering about &quot;the devil's work&quot; in leading you to a sense of unworthiness. That seems to me to be possibly very important and an insight you need to pay attention to. Somebody long ago, almost as a joke, &quot;If that's true, it's important.&quot; I think there's a lot of that in our lives.</p>
<p>I would love to work with you in reading <span id="Romans"></span><strong>Romans</strong>. I'm just a little guy, not like Barth or Luther or many others who found their truest voice of faith in their interpretation of Romans -- <span id="but"></span><strong>but</strong> opening up Romans was a vital part of my adult conversion experience.</p>
<p>Mary Pat and I had intended to be at Our Savior for your preaching, but I was called on very short notice to supply in Camden, so that's where we were yesterday. Mary Pat and I are interested in finding a time for study/prayer. Would Wednesday at 5:30 at Mary Pat's office work for you?</p>
<p>Faithfully, Dale +</p>
