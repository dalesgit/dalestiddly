<h1 id="emmas-letter">Emma’s letter</h1>
<p>Matthew McConaughey on the Colbert show last night described getting up for an hour of time focused on himself. One example he identified was watching the sunrise. I’ve had the same intention of late. Partly I’ve been waking, as today, at 5:30 or so, needing to pee but then unable to get back to sleep, even though lying on my right side feels so comfortable.</p>
<p>Emma responded, “I got your letter. Thank you for the gift.” At first I was reluctant to share it with Mary Pat, but finally I did. She responded saying that, “It is an opening.” Then went on to mention that Owen’s children never responded to us at all about the thousands of dollars we gave them, or any other gifts for that matter. Then she said, that sometimes Lydia was not responsive.</p>
<p>The truth is that I felt hurt by the minimal response and then dismissed, even lectured to, by MP’s response to me. I thought, “How dare she criticize my children.” That’s been a part of my reflections these months of my struggle with Sean’s presence, that MP would not fare nearly as well as I have if we had taken in one of my children. She feels pretty free to criticize my kids.</p>
<p>Maybe I should feel freer to criticize.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-it-mean-to-show-up">What does it mean to “show up”</h1>
<p>I came away from the session with Linda focused on responding to Emma, not being passive. Now that has come full circle and it seems pretty empty.</p>
<p>I began the project to make a small case for my phone and a few cards. But I missed my exercise. Up and down. My weight is creeping down. Part of the day yesterday it was below 200 and part just over.</p>
<h1 id="peter-christinas">Peter &amp; Christina’s</h1>
<p>Christina was the most forthright, asking questions that reflected Mary Pat’s confessional kind of sharing. Peter had been a little more circumspect, asking, “How are things at home?”</p>
<p>I ended up sharing much more than I wanted or perhaps should have. Things like the boundaries that have been crossed with Sean. Rendering a narrative of my “knowing Sean” to illustrate that all I’ve known is betrayal and dishonesty. Sharing enough to show that I know that Mary Pat has a mother’s perspective on all of this. Sharing enough to say that (having been through Jacob’s shit and Bridget’s betrayal) I’ve had enough. Christina asking, “Is that fair to Sean?” And my response that, “It’s not about Sean with me, it’s about Mary Pat.” (In so many words.) So I pursued it since MP had shared so much (how much I don’t know) that at least I should even the playing field.</p>
<p>Peter seemed particularly sensitive to my statement that Sean is not paying his fair share, he is not being prepared to move out. Peter seemed to understand my statement that I might be willing to continue at WU if it was to benefit the department. Also, he is equally concerned long-term with the sustainability of the American model of academia. WU needs to “save” 1.4 mill $ this next year, through all the various means: retirements, not replacement, canceling programs, …</p>
<p>They both knew something about Linda E. Christina said, “Linda was married to … but now she’s divorced.” Peter asked about who I was doing spiritual direction with. I related how the fellow in the mountains and the woman in Virginia was available and brought some of the values I was looking for, but Linda brought: enneagram, Ignatian spirituality, an awareness of 12 step, … and I might have added step-parenting.</p>
