<p>I was in a place like Colorado Springs. There was family around but I was alone. I had set out on some task. I had driven the white Kia. It was a familiar route, but somehow changed or I wasn't remembering well. I parked somewhere and walked and walked. Maybe ran a bit. Maybe some other mobility. Did what I needed, I think, more or less. But then trying to get back to where I needed to be. Mary Pat was somewhere north. Somewhere other than where I was. I couldn't quite remember where the car was. I tried and tried. But I couldn't remember where I parked it. I couldn't get back.</p>
<p>It seems as if some friendly folks had taken me, perhaps out of the weather. And finally I called Mary Pat. And she just kind of laughed and conveyed to me that it was my problem and I'd have to deal with it.</p>

<p>We had watched <em>The Notebook</em> and MP had wondered how much of the Alzheimer theme Bill and Karla were actually aware of. I thought they were, but by the end I thought perhaps it was too close to home for them to have enjoyed.</p>
<p>Bill &amp; Karla and I had gone to Jamestown without MP. She was sick and the walking would have been too severe. Then with the preparation for dinner (leftovers), the 3 of us were doing part of the task and it felt like MP was sitting alone, allowing herself to be waited on. Then we didn't do it the way she wanted. Then I lost it because I didn't know all of what was going on. I told her she needed to get involved. Her response was to walk away and attempt to leave me on my own.</p>
