<p>Waiting to see about how to adjust Christmas services. Plan B.</p>
<p>What is at stake for me (St. Peter’s) using the 3 readings for today?</p>
<ul>
<li>Charles Smith, cf. Is 6 “the eyar that King Uzziah died” – 2020 has been a year of the king dying. Having outdoor service at 3pm – the warmest day of the year? Then virtual on Christmas morn and beyond – while people traveling. 2 people added (2% of congregation?) 15-20 minutes Youtube analytics is the amount of people stay attentive. His goal is 25 min. max for service.</li>
<li>Daniel Hank: there have been few centuries when the church was primarily large gatherings of people for worship. Rather banished to islands and such.</li>
<li>Dimarteo: don’t know what to say. Groundhog day every day.</li>
<li>D.apoldo: people will do what I tell them, but … Do what I can do and let people decide for themselves. I struggle with telling people what to do. Common time of zoning out is at the Prayers of the People.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s at stake for us.</p>
<p>Sacramental faithfulness.</p>
<p>Keeping people safe.</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Unpredictable consequences</p>
<p>Desires of others</p>
<p>Pastoral resonse</p>
<p>Precedent</p>
<p>Pressure from others</p>
<p>Fear of rejection or conflict</p>
<p>Bp. W.: Stephen Rhodes has a proposal.</p>
<p>SR: We reopened Oct. 4. No cases to date, keep contact lists. Planning for Christmas, 530 at St. James, inquiries about whether they would be open. Cases are going up in community. How do compromise? Safe but honoring those who don’t want to be there.</p>
<ul>
<li>lay visitors, Good Friday communion from Thursday Eucharist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible to have an exemption so that people could pick up envelope of pre-consecrated hosts? Compete against “secularization” of Christmas.</p>
<p>Bp. W.: Communion at Christmas. He’s some reluctant to do the wide-spread distrubtion of pre-consecrated. Respect “college of clergy”. Are we ok with other people doing things we are opposed to? Every congregation is different. Every priest different. (Anna) said that she would appreciate clarity of direction from Bp. so that all we’re doing is following the diocesan direction, rather than “I’m deciding to do …” Another priest gets blowback about why Presbyterians, Methodists doing such and such, not Episcopal Diocese as such.</p>
<p>Fr. Eichelberger at St. Andrew’s is obviously an Anglo-Catholic parish – incense every Sunday, although not doing since Covid.</p>
<p>AW: He likes deacons to be a little bit edgy (addressed to d’Rue. What does he mean?</p>
<p>What’s difference between reverence and scrupulosity? Amos – your sacrifices …</p>
<p>Several clergy have 30% or greater infection rates. One has had 3 deaths in the latest time. Even still gathering 1 time per month in parking lot. Harrison, Anna, we are all in different circumstances. We need “flexibility”. Trust the other clergy.</p>
<p>AW: what’s complicated about “flexibility” – plenty under current guidelines – there is more reactivity in some congregations than in others. Going too strict. Sometimes too open. Affecting the clergy person’s relationship to the congregation. If the word goes out that you can do whatever you want (as the priest) some clergy will be in tough places.</p>
<p>AW: We’re still not doing the cup!</p>
<p>St. Luke’s (newby): Wonders why there’s so much variability among the clergy with re. Eucharistic Theology according to the BCP?</p>
<p>AW: provide clarity that has our backs but also gives flexibility. The more I ponder this moment, the more I recognize how much dependent on the grace, mercy of God. We won’t have it perfect … Some people have reported that Church is the only place they feel safe gathering in person.</p>
