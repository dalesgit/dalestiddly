<h1 id="sleep">Sleep</h1>
<p>I couldn’t sleep. I got up at 5 and was cold. Went back to bed and couldn’t. Got up at 6. Thinking about computer things.</p>
<h1 id="such-a-day-all-saints">Such a day: All Saints</h1>
<p>On my walk I listened to lectures on Dionysius the Aereopagite and Augustine, on the one hand, and Maimonides and Kabbalah on the other. Developments of Platonism into the Judaeo-Christian communities. All Saints always in the background, but me aware that I observed the day less than at any time since the 1970’s.</p>
<p>Resentment at how Sean controls our days. What we eat for dinner. When we eat. How it is to be prepared. When we fill the gas tank. Oh, I’m so weary of it.</p>
<p>And Mary Pat says to me, dripping in sentimentality and (messaging?) “Do you remember when you loved men?”</p>
