<p>Peter and Christina's date was a happy occasion. &quot;Chris's sister in law&quot; was doing all the housework, kitchen-work etc. Beth Costner refused to say a word to Mary Pat. For me, perhaps, the most unexpected things were 2. The husband of Jean, the sociology chair, attends Our Saviour. He has reported to Jean that &quot;this guy on your floor&quot; preaches there and &quot;he's really good.&quot; I may have blunted his good intentions by telling a story including how many people just do a perfunctory &quot;I enjoyed your sermon father.&quot;</p>
<p>Secondly, I had occasion to talk to 2 students who knew me: Grant &amp; Victoria Burdett. I talked with both about my struggle to discern whether I had a voice or a message that would be helpful to the students. Both of them were adamant that I did. Grant, whom I had for 3 classes, particularly was full of praise and encouragement. Earlier in the day, in my cleaning, I had run across a review sheet from Peter about my teaching. In a table of grades, he had marked all of them &quot;acceptable&quot; for an adjunct, except the top one about being prepared and knowledgable which he marked &quot;superior&quot;.</p>
<p>Peter is working at home on 2 things.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>His proposed book on suffering. I shared my sermon where Amos informed the interpretation of the Mary/Martha pericope. I suggested listening for what the prophets had to say about suffering after he had expressed frustration at not finding a focus. He began with a quick overview -- which I don't have at my fingertips the way he does:
<ul>
<li>Job</li>
<li>accounts of suffering in the psalms</li>
<li>Isaiah, &quot;suffering servant.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>His course on &quot;Women in the Bible.&quot; He expressed surprise at how much he didn't know. I shared that Schussler-Fiorenza had been at Notre Dame when I was there and that I, too, had felt challenged by the femininist critique.</li>
</ol>
<p>I envied him his theological skills and opportunities to exercise them.</p>
