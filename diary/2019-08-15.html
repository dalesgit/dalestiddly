<h1 id="examen-on-yesterday-morning-examen-on-yesterday-morning">Examen on yesterday (morning) {#Examen on yesterday (morning)}</h1>
<p>Examen of Conscience (Consciousness)</p>
<ul>
<li>What surprised me today? I was surprised at how much friction between Mary Pat and I there is over Mom's will stuff</li>
<li>What inspired me today? zen statements?</li>
<li>What touched me today? Annie's gift that MP sent and saw a picture of on their doorstep -- courtesy of Amazon. A knitting bowl. Annie reported that there was one woman in their knitting group that had one. Annie had always that that she must be very rich and that she (Annie) would never be able to have such a wonderful piece.</li>
</ul>
<p>FROM CHARLES CAVE</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I enjoy doing today? Writing. Making the reservations at []{#the Pump House}<strong>the Pump House</strong> for Sunday night.</li>
<li>What would I like to more of?</li>
<li>What would I like to do less of? Missing the mark, communication, with Mary Pat.</li>
<li>What did I learn today? I reviewed the items from Mom's house, the &quot;lady pictures&quot;. MP saw them. It didn't seem so formidable but soaked in the <span id="spirit"></span><strong>spirit</strong> of mom. I read the will. I looked through the photos of mom from the funeral with MP. She wasn't very interested.</li>
<li>What will I do differently tomorrow? I hope that her back pain will be improved. She asked me to rub around her kidneys but that only made it worse.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Dreaming">Dreaming</h1>
<p>I was doing church work. I was working with groups. Maybe a little the evening with Barb, Sue, and Olga-Maria. They each had their own pastoral universe. Mary Pat had been in charge there. There were, in the dream, competing needs and views of the world.</p>
<p>I wondered as I was waking from the dream whether the focus on church work was a message about what my primary focus ought to be in retirement. Not academia, but the church. I have been cavalier in many ways, not paying attention to the political aspects of the Episcopal Church, dismissing them too easily perhaps. But it has been very good to write them off as in the larger scheme of things not being very important.</p>
