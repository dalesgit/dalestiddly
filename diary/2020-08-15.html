<p>71</p>
<p>Something in your voice that made me hear it.<br />
Silence. “How does it feel to be 71?” Pause?</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>Like a classic car.<br />
Like a Ham Radio code.<br />
Like a ratio for vinaigrette.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something in the way you move<br />
That seems to leave this troubled world behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s measured but quantum, not Newtonian,<br />
Musical-like, rhythm and tune. It’s the pause that gives the meaning,<br />
Pirouette from plodding to soaring,<br />
From melodrama to weightless grace Like the dancer’s leap, caught in mid-air.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She’s been with me now quite a long, long time<br />
And I feel fine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s measured in breathless moments that rest between<br />
The uttered and the utteree<br />
Measured in the space between,<br />
That binds, engages, encompasses, embraces, encircles, twines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It isn’t what she’s got to say<br />
But how she thinks and where she’s been</p>
</blockquote>
<p>71 is a good vintage,</p>
<p>But 49 was the birth afterall,<br />
That gives today our<br />
Vintage wine. An anniversary to keep. Years to match.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I feel fine anytime she’s around me now</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something in your voice, your eyes,<br />
Your hand to the stars,<br />
That brings rejoice in me.</p>
<p>Something I can’t say, you can’t hold it still,<br />
Neither of us engrave, neither embalm,<br />
Shrouded in the unspoken yearning<br />
That spills onto the kitchen floor you’re<br />
Dancing on to express your love<br />
That makes me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>feel fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>49. 71. Today. The best of days.</p>
<p>It is good, he said. And on the 7th day rested,<br />
Blessed to have come this far<br />
With your hand in mine<br />
And our silences in touch.</p>
<p>Thank you, my dear.</p>
