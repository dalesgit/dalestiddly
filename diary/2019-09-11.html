<h1 id="a-day-of-silences-a-day-of-silences">A day of silences {#A day of silences}</h1>
<p>It's been a day of virtually no communication. At one point I said, &quot;Can I say something?&quot; She nodded. &quot;I have tried to give you space. I don't intend to avoid you. I am looking for a sign or a word from you.&quot; (Something to that effect.) Her answer was to say, &quot;Thank you.&quot; And that's it.</p>
<p>We traded places being in the living room or in the bedroom. I had a good bike ride. She asked how it was. Then we watched the news together. There was no interaction. Now it's 8pm and she is in the bedroom, with her hoodie pulled up around her face. I am sweating hot, having got out of the shower. I asked her if she wanted me to heat anything up to eat. She said, &quot;No thank you.&quot; That's it.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do. I don't want life without her. She is obviously very hurt. Very angry. I don't know whether she's looking for me to do something or whether she's waiting until she decides what she is going to do.</p>
