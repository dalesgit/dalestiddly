<ul>
<li>We spent an hour plus at a neighborhood party hosted by Sarah Allen. I didn't want to be there, but chose to go because of Mary Pat, who wanted very much to go. I explained that concept to MP, but I think she didn't accept it. For her you do what you want and that's it. I said, &quot;I can choose to do what I don't want to do.&quot;</li>
<li>I installed midi stuff on the Linux in back, found the webcam, and reinstalled (Flatpak) Zoom. It took some doing, with glitches I solved but couldn't have if I didn't have 20+ years experience with Linux.</li>
<li>I graded and commented on 8-10 <em>God on trial</em> worksheets. I was so impressed with the thoughtfulness the students put into it -- even when I thought they were being naive and pietistic. They clearly didn't apply the principles of the chapter or of the presentation. []{#Pay attention to this for next semester.}<strong>Pay attention to this for next semester.</strong> (Winthrop)</li>
<li>Returning to the &quot;midi&quot; zoo I remembered lots of hours spent with it from St. Andrew's to St. Mary's. Rosegarden. Qsynth. aconnect gui. Musescore. Lilypond. I wonder if tex is still a requirement for Lilypond?</li>
<li>The setup with Zoom on the office computer was a little bit fun because I was using hardware that was 12-14 years old.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-crack-in-bowl-the-crack-in-bowl">The crack in bowl? {#The crack in bowl?}</h1>
<p>Perhaps it is the issue of wanting and choosing. I spent a lot of my life doing what I &quot;ought&quot; to do, thus sacrificing who I was. Pleasing my father, etc. But &quot;choosing&quot; something and being okay with it seems equally powerful to me. It feels like all of the great acts of generosity and sacrifice are based on that. Jäggerstätter, Jesus, Henry Nouwen. Each of them found their <span id="joy"></span><strong>joy</strong> in doing what they chose. Maybe that's it. Finding my <span id="joy"></span><strong>joy</strong>.</p>
<p>Ross Gay was claiming &quot;delight&quot; for his life. From the movie last night, <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, we saw a heart-warming love story -- heart-breaking too. Will chose in the end to see what would happen with &quot;a girl&quot;. He didn't know the answer but he accepted the concept that he had to be all in to be able to find out. I thought repeatedly last night that that's what I had done with Mary Pat.</p>
<h1 id="worked-on-today-worked-on-today">Worked on today {#Worked on today}</h1>
<ul>
<li>Decided that I would create a BlackBoard test. Using rubrics. And Fill in the blank where I provide the definition. This would indicate I think that there be more vocabulary items, because it's a lot easier to identify that way.</li>
<li>graded ca. 6 more worksheets.</li>
<li>Figured out that if I mount the camera in the middle of the screen I will be getting better eye contact than having it permanently at the top of the screen. I'm thinking that might be the way the more professional folks do it. I guess I actually don't need the screen at all if I'm used to looking at a camera.</li>
