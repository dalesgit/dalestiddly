<p>Oh this could be fairly nice, to get to a vim editing session simply by entering a &quot;chroot&quot; and beginning to type. Dropbox is not running, so that's a downside. Or perhaps getting some graphical stuff by running &quot;Gtkdialog menu&quot;.</p>
<p>This was about several elements of xiwi gtkdialog menu working. The problem solving had to do with the complex bash statement that allowed for &quot;dropbox status&quot; to feed a result to a &quot;yad&quot; window. It took a while. It wasn't intuitive. But I got it working with &quot;xarg&quot; statement. I didn't understand all of the details -- reference to the web site in &quot;checkvist&quot; file &quot;Personal&quot; -- but I understood the basic elements.</p>
<p>Sense of satisfaction. That sent me off to go shopping with MP. That was good enough. But then we spent time with Ed &amp; Becky. Then I needed time to wash the car at the manual car wash. And the motor for the garage door stopped working.</p>
<p>Getting all of that going again. And dealing with a phone call from Bill &amp; Karla *&amp; then overlapped with a call with Julian. All related to spending time with them.</p>
<p>I hope it goes well.</p>

<ul>
<li>What surprised me today? That I didn't have to work on a sermon. The satisfaction, I think, has to do with putting one letter in front of another, crafting a sentence. My desire to speak in complete sentences.</li>
<li>What inspired me today? The little bit I was able to make Ed feel like he had been <span id="heard"></span><strong>heard</strong>.</li>
<li>What touched me today? Watching Lester Holtz on being in prison and listening to prisoners. What are the basic elements of American society that provide evidence that this is a not good place:
<ul>
<li>guns and gun violence</li>
<li>percentage of population incarcerated, together with our vindictive attitude. Cp. we saw last night &quot;July 22&quot; about the world's worst mass murderer, in Norway in 2014. He received a sentence of 20 years, but he can only be released if he is judged to be safe to society.</li>
<li>the huge inequity of our health insurance system</li>
<li>the over-sized impact we have had on the death of our planet through global warming. I would have to include the unbelievable self-centeredness and blindness and insensitivity -- to say nothing of stupidity -- of the many Republicans (and others) who deny the human impact on the killing of the planet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What did I enjoy doing today? Writing. Solving computer problem.</li>
<li>What would I like to more of?</li>
<li>What would I like to do less of? Struggling for my voice to be heard. Solving problems like the garage door opener.</li>
<li>What did I learn today?</li>
<li>What will I do differently tomorrow? Sew on the machine some of my tasks for the house. I will feel satisfied from it.</li>
</ul>
