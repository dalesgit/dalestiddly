<h1 id="dreaming">Dreaming</h1>
<p>I was living in several dreams, back to back, in Hawai’i. One of the constants in the dreams was Bill Mok. He was cordial if not friendly. And it wasn’t particularly about the church. I had looked up St. Mary’s before going to bed. The new rector was writing letters on the letterhead that I had designed and Murray had printed. But my dreams seemed broader than the church. It was home – again.</p>
