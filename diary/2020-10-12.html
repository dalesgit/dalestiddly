<h1 id="last-dream-before-waking">Last dream before waking</h1>
<p>I was the adult amidst a bunch of children. There was some kind of pattern and some kind of back-story: I was a parent there, I was a teacher maybe, or something. I came across a group of children I thought were just playing. But then quickly I got a flash. Somebody was urinating on a smaller child. I walked over to intervene. The larger bullying boys scattered, particularly the urinator. I wasn’t concerned about them, but somewhat relieved that they didn’t attack me. I turned to the little girl. I tried to talk calmly to her and to tell her to come to me if anybody did something like that again. It seemed pitifully little, but I thought she may at least feel like there is an ally somewhere.</p>
<p>On waking I thought of the Jacob incident at St. Andrew’s. I wondered if the perpetrator was Sean. I know – and even knew in the dream – that I’m no hero. That I have trouble doing the right thing, even when I know quite clearly what the right thing is. I also know that the state’s way of solving it – that all children incidents must be reported to “authorities” is itself a bullying ploy. I resisted it then and I would resist it now. It is what got Sean and his parents into trouble then and the rebound of it may be at work even to this day in my home.</p>
<p>We watched the movie <em>Frailty</em> – described as a Gothic horror story: Hitchcock and Poe and Roger Ebert gave it 4 out of 4. One of the people involved said that he especially liked Steven King novels as he was growing up. Perhaps that touches on my dream. Perhaps the S. King connection explains Mary Pat’s choosing the film.</p>
<h2 id="tables-turned">Tables turned</h2>
<p>And so, tonight, I wonder what it would be like if the tables were turned. What would be the circumstances and the response if it was Emma who had retreated to our house, to recover, to find her life again. What would Mary Pat’s response be.</p>
<p>I look at him lounging on the sofa, as we watch a show we are all interested in, caught up in, <em>The Designated Survivor</em> . He has only shorts on. His tattoos broadcast a kind of “fuck you” to all who look on. Everytime I think that a mother would love her son being home – but others, maybe not so much. I struggle with abhorring it. Like his inability to put a place setting on the table.</p>
<p>I dare not focus on that because it would be so petty. But perhaps I could promulgate a rule that if one does the dishes, you do everything that needs washing, and the goal is to leave it cleaner than you found it. Brother ?? That was what someone remembered about him.</p>
<p>George and he died around the same time. Brother ?? impacted me almost as much as George.</p>
