<p>==Last full day with Miriam==</p>
<p>We traveled to downtown Olympia. It seemed like a smallish town, Asheville, maybe, made for artsy-craftsy folks, perhaps because there was a vortex nearby or other spiritual foci. But it's the capital.</p>
<p>We were headed to a toy store that might provide a &quot;Road Grater&quot; for me to buy Will. I thought of it back in Sedona and Miriam had said that Will loved them. He clearly loves trucks. Among his favorite is the &quot;Gaga truck&quot; which is the []{#garbage truck.}<strong>garbage truck.</strong> The regular garbage truck driver in their block usually waves at Will when he comes by.</p>
<p>We found a large earth-mover and a large stuffed white unicorn for the two children. River fell asleep in her bed with her arms around the unicorn. (Miriam sent a picture).</p>
<p>Mary Pat shared with her the dynamics of our timeshare property, hoping to enlist her in our being able to give them some time together. This next summer there will be a Sophie's wedding and then a hoped for Alaskan cruise with Lee's parents (50th anniv) and Lee &amp; Miriam (10th anniv.) and someone else.</p>
<p>I keep feeling like Miriam doesn't really listen very deeply. Perhaps she doesn't have enough energy left. I told her that of the 3 of the older kids, I thought yesterday with Mary Pat that Julian was the one most like me. She asked how? I said:</p>
<ul>
<li>personality traits</li>
<li>I wanted to be a ski bum but didn't have the courage.</li>
<li>both caring and in touch with their feminine side.</li>
<li>a sense of never growing up</li>
</ul>
