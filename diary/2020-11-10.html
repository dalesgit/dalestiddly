<h1 id="difficulty-sleeping">Difficulty sleeping</h1>
<p>I went to sleep easily. I was sleepy when MP went off to get Sean. I knew that she would expect staying up and watching something when she got back. So I wanted to at least be on my way to bed by the time she got back. Almost 10, I was brushing my teeth.</p>
<p>Then she acted surprised and “resentful?” that I said that I wasn’t coming back out. She asked, “Is there a reason why?” I think supposing I was angry or something. I said, “No. I want some quiet before I go to sleep.” I woke after a couple of hours. She was in bed reading. After peeing I tried going back to sleep. I think I did for maybe 1 hour, then by fits got an hour here and there. I spent a good bit of time in the living room. Some just thinking, some reading.</p>
<p>I looked at the material from Linda. It was on “discernment.” The memoir has the narrator very much going through discernment – major mid-life conversion stuff. I wondered what is the question? What is the discernment I face. By the time I finally was able to get back to sleep I had settled on the notion that I was facing a deeper commitment to living a God-life, like the narrator.</p>
<p>As I made coffee this morning I thought maybe the “it” is whether to teach. Linda seemed to really press me on “why” I was thinking about not teaching. That’s certainly a more discrete, easier, discernment to process.</p>
<p>What is my current discernment? I wondered in the night why I couldn’t sleep. The more obvious possible reason seemed to be that Mary Pat and I are going to couple’s counseling today. I might well do a “Freudian slip” and call her Bridget. Bridget has slid into my consciousness lately because of Emma’s wedding and pictures. I think Mo and I had some sessions but I can’t remember them. Maybe not. With Bridget it’s not a good association.</p>

<p>It’s called a “tailor’s ham”. I think it must have been my mother, but maybe it was Mo who had one.</p>
