<h1 id="Preaching">Preaching</h1>
<p>In my dreaming before getting up I was []{#so energized}<strong>so energized</strong>! I was preaching. Or maybe just putting to paper my sermons. It grew out of reading some of my past sermons as I was trying to figure out the best workflow. Perhaps shifting to <em>Joplin</em>.</p>
<p>But one thing came through. A tremendous enthusiasm for just preaching what I knew -- out of the current events of my real life experiences.</p>
<p>So I was enthused about 4 Advent.</p>
<ul>
<li>inexpensive, inexperienced movie people (the little people like me)</li>
<li>movie that didn't kill metaphor, kill imagination</li>
<li>the importance of little people from the perspective of the <span id="universe"></span><strong>universe</strong></li>
<li>We couldn't talk about God or God's work without metaphor and imagination
<ul>
<li>God is love -- not the kind of love I'm most associated with</li>
<li>Happy days -- not the holidays I know</li>
<li>Angels that look like cherubs -- &quot;angels often come disguised as teachers&quot; -- but they always are disguised</li>
<li>God in the silence -- allowing space for imagination</li>
<li>even contemplation which clears out our imagination to let God in</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>And Christmas Day. The Gretchen Pritchard piece.</p>
<ul>
<li>I usually have used that on Easter time.</li>
<li>Telling of stories is what it's all about</li>
<li>Jesus is the answer -- but we have to know the question</li>
<li>It will be all right in the end. If it's not all right yet, it's not the end</li>
</ul>
<p>And Christmas 1. Logos.</p>
<p>Just preach what you know, Dale.</p>
