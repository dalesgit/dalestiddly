<h1 id="dream-of-dad">Dream of Dad</h1>
<p>I’m writing, having just awakened enough to manage this. I was leading a group that felt mostly like Monroe Episcopalians. Some elements of Hawai’i and my traditional dream where I was having trouble doing what was supposed to be done. The church had somehow suffered some devastation, flooding? But with a lot of help from folks I started the prayer. It was an introduction. Whoever was usually in charge – a female bishop? the normal pastor? – had told me that while she was doing a more familiar rite 2 something, I was to do Rite 1 Morning Prayer. I had to think about it. WHile I was thinking, I did this introduction. I did that sort of thing in Monroe. They liked. I enjoyed myself.</p>
<p>The focus was prayer. I commended them in their prayer. People had suffered, perhaps died, so I knew they were grieving and I knew that there were faithful prayers. But I started with the example that Mary Pat prayed. I knew about that. And I knew second hand that they were prayers – I was visualizing (the Sr. Warden and her husband? I can’t say the names right now.)</p>
<p>But then I looked up and within about 15 feet, it felt like right in front of me, was my father, looking right at me.</p>
<p>I was overcome, like the speaker on the news giving reports on Covid, I had trouble going on and I felt a flood of tears coming over me.</p>
<p>I did keep going, but only briefly before I woke.</p>
<h1 id="major-insight">Major insight?</h1>
<p>Really in the shower, but after a nap, trying to think of things to do to escape the doldrums I feel, I unexpectedly realized that the satisfaction that I get from solving computer puzzles, or of getting a computer to “<strong>do something</strong>” is kin to the satisfaction I get from woodworking and sewing. Julian and I have it.</p>
<p>Maybe I will start cooking like soups or gaspacho like stuff. Healthy eating.</p>
<h1 id="goodnight">Goodnight</h1>
<p>What a doldrum of a day. I had some insights during my walk. Violence and death during Reformation. How compare with violence and death over telling someone to wear a mask during pandemic? Also how to manage the collaboration and groups in my classes next semester.</p>
<p>I spent some time dreaming of sewing. Maybe making a bag. Return to my first sewing project?</p>
<p>Mostly I felt lost today. Erin? Linda? I am going to have to face them soon.</p>
