<h1 id="Discouragement">Discouragement</h1>
<p>It feels like a whole series of depressing events have gone down.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Republican Party is determining that the behavior of Trump, that puts Nixon's crimes to shame, is just normal behavior now.</li>
<li>The move to Florida is unlikely to happen</li>
<li>Instead Sean is likely to come live with us next year</li>
<li>The prospects of a redemptive time for MP and her mother has turned into a pathetic time of alienation</li>
<li>The heroes have become the &quot;saints of E. David ST.&quot; For them MP's relationship seems to have been cut off long ago</li>
<li>Today is the day &quot;George left.&quot;</li>
<li>The vibrancy of a new car, new geography, riding my bicycle in Naples FL, ... has turned into the drudgery of winter in a place I don't like</li>
</ul>
<p>What's wrong with me.</p>

<p>MP asked me to imagine that I was a priest and a couple came to me with the issues she shared with Christina. (cp. I asked her if she had been a principal with the issues her family presented.)</p>
<p>One major response: She said she needed me to support her as she seeks to do what is right with her family. I asked her what the &quot;support&quot; looked like. She says I would be with her. But she allows that I might not need to be at the house the whole time she was. She is ok with staying in a motel.</p>
<p>She was expecting to go up following the last of the Dec. appointments (viz. 12/8 or so).</p>
<p>I tried to say to her that if I were that priest I would try to prompt the spouse to examine what she truly <span id="needs"></span><strong>needs</strong>, recognizing that not everyone can supply all that we <span id="need"></span><strong>need</strong>. Christina things that our dependency on one another is a good thing -- even as MP wondered whether there is []{#too much}<strong>too much</strong>.</p>

<p>Set in 2022. Dystopian. Made in 1970. Spectacular prescience and eerie viewing from this perspective.</p>
