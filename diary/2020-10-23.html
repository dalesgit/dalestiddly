<p>I went to sleep having played for a few moments with the Markdown software “Obsidian”. It is very intriguing, though sadly not open source. It allows for re-visualizing a folder of markdown files.</p>
<p>In my dream, evidently, the upcoming encounter of Hawai’i in tomorrow’s convention was on my heart. I was in Hawai’i. Following a basic pattern that I’ve had for a long time, I was wondering in a church oriented place. There was a lot that seemed abandoned or re-purposed. There were gatherings of Christians I sort of recognized. But I felt disconnected from them. And I felt OK about it.Not in the sense that I was at peace with a separation, but that I am identifying less and less with the Episcopal church.</p>
<p>The lectures I am finishing about the early modern Reformation has affected me. The lecturer is obviously no friend of Catholicism or Anglicanism, but he matter-of-factly claims that the Elizabethan settlement was in fact a Protestant move, just one with nuance and calculated political appeal.</p>
<p>The Protestants he describes across many lectures are indeed plagued with a virus that seems to be in the DNA, one of division and rancor and self-grandiosity. And the violence, present on all sides, of Christianity in the 16th-17th centuries is breathtaking.</p>
