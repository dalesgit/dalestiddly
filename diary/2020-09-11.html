<h1 id="anniversary">9/11 anniversary</h1>
<p>We’ve watched several videos. It has been a long time since I have been so immersed in the anniversary. The feelings are a strange mixture. Clearly a life-changing time. The country never the same. Yet I said to MP that I thought that the nation has been more damaged by Donald Trump than by the terrorists on that day. My life has changed so much in the intervening 20 years. There was an article today and MP mentioned that far more have died from Covid than did that day. What I had in mind was that in the last 4 years more of the principles that make us who we are as a nation have been destroyed. We remember how George W. brought us together as a nation for the 1st month or so. Then his murderous, treacherous attacks on Iraq began to be put into place.</p>
<p>Even more profoundly I sense that just as my years are decreasing, human life on the planet is counting down. If Lydia and Emma are resentful at what I passed onto them, maybe it’s understandable in the global perspective. If only they could know the depth of love I tried to pass on to them. But I failed.</p>
