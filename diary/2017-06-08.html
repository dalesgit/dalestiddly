<p>It is now the 3rd day of coughing for Mary Pat. It hasn't got better -- maybe worse. And I had to conclude this morning that we will need to get a motel room in Las Cruces to protect Mom. That will lead to various interesting consequences.</p>
<p>Yesterday we traveled from the <span id="South"></span><strong>South</strong> to the <span id="West"></span><strong>West</strong>, Louisiana to Abilene. We were just past Vicksburg in Louisiana, the Mississippi delta environment all around. I didn't really know what was a &quot;bayou&quot; but I think we were in the midst of it. By mid-day we past the very wet East Texas environment, headed for Dallas which was still green. But I could tell as if smelling it in the air that we were approaching Mesquite environment. In San Antonio, at the Johnson ranch, I learned about a line that runs north and south somewhere to the west of Dallas/Ft. Worth where precipitation drops off and one enters a desert-like environment.</p>

<p>Mary Pat is struggling. Mom is angry. I am uncomfortable and worn out. Mom asked Shirley nicely I think in her letter to come visit her. Shirley in a bizarre letter explained that they just would not be able to make it this year.</p>
