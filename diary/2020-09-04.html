<h1 id="worst-night">Worst night</h1>
<p>It turns out that last night might have been the worst night ever. And it so didn’t have to be that way. I asked the question, “What is your schedule tomorrow.” She went through Sean’s work schedule, and I reminded her that I couldn’t see any of that.</p>
<p>She evidently thought I was upset about it and stormed to the bathroom. I went back and calmly said, “I don’t understand. What is it that made you upset?” She responded by blaming me for all of it, for being upset and uncooperative.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see a resolution before going to bed. Bad, bad, bad.</p>
<p>The little piece I saw in the Enneagram about when #2’s feel threatened and insecure they become little tyrants.</p>
<p>She and Sean are doing their thing.</p>
<h1 id="form-for-spiritual-direction.">Form for Spiritual Direction.</h1>
<p>I am a retired Episcopal priest. I have children aged 43-26, grandchildren aged 20-5. I have taught in high school, college, and university. I learned a lot about ministry when I sold office equipment for a couple of years. I enjoy walking and listening to blogs. Playing the piano has been therapeutic from when I was still a young boy.</p>
<p>I have had a spiritual director for most of the time between 1979 and the present, although I have not seen my last director for several years now since moving from Hawai’i to South Carolina. I have considered it an essential part of my ministry, taking to mind that no one should be presumptious to offer direction or counsel or hear confessions who is not also in some kind of spiritual friendship relationship. The first time I heard about spiritual direction was probably 1979 or 1980. For several years Kenneth Leech was a visiting lecturer at my seminary. Later I have been inspired by others who have made important contributions, including John O’Donohue.</p>
<p>My hopes for spiritual direction are to find a spiritual companion for these years of my life / ministry. I continue to do supply work in churches and for the moment I am still trying to introduce people to the academic study of religion. Direction can be an important component of that vocation. Additionally, there are plenty of stresses. I just read today of one person putting forth that the thing to do at times of great stress is to <strong>dance</strong>. I’m not a dancer, but I’d like to dance.</p>
<p>No questions. Awaiting the conversation.</p>
