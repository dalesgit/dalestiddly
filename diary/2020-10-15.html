<p>#mary-pat</p>
<p>Mary Pat slept in the living room last night. She couldn’t find a way to reconcile sleeping next to me I think. I have been pretty determined not to make that choice.</p>
<p>She had said that “well, then, I guess Sean and I will move out tomorrow.” I tried to firmly but kindly say that I didn’t think that would help. That it wouldn’t make the pain go away. I don’t know if she heard that, or more precisely, I don’t know how she heard that. We hear such different things these days. That fits one of the categories of “codependency”.</p>
<h1 id="evening">Evening</h1>
<p>On my walk I imagined writing a short note to MP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The elephant in the room that I referred to was not a person, it was “codependency.” I conclude from your words and actions of the last 3 days that you do not have any intention of being responsive to my thoughts or feelings. If that is not your intention, you should let me know somehow or other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now she has gone out again to spend time with Christina before going on to get Sean. In her episode with him this morning she ended up junking the battery that was in the Miata and Sean magnanimously was able to buy a new one from his work. Christina had seemed before to be quite unaware of 12 step vocabulary or concepts. Now she has become, obviously, an ally. I’m glad MP has a friend. But it seems like friendship is not helping our relationship.</p>
<p>She had returned from her adventure with Sean to inform me that she had decided that we should agree to never talk to one another the way we did yesterday – even though it’s not an ideal solution, it’s better to be silent. One more “I have decided” although I could agree basically with her sentiment. I wondered how much she reckoned that her expletive spewed on me was a part of what she was talking about. “You’re a fucking liar.” At the very least I suppose she figures she was spurred on by me.</p>
<p>Linda – I don’t know what to do. Giving up is high on my list.</p>
