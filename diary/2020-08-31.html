<h1 id="sean">Sean</h1>
<p>:boundaries:</p>
<p>Mary Pat thinks that “Cheap Grace” refers to the charge God puts on the grace. She apologized for not knowing the correct theological terms when I showed exasperation. “Cheap grace” has to do with the price humans put on it. God’s price isn’t cheap, it’s free.</p>
<p>Sean screwed up yesterday. He did a manic something or other in the kitchen and then lied about going out and bingeing on something.</p>
<ul>
<li>I told MP that his game plan is to drive a wedge between us. I really, really don’t want that to happen.</li>
<li>I have implored her to think in terms of boundaries.</li>
<li>She rejects my suggestion that he pay rent and grocery money to us – which could well be put into “escrow”, but the point being that it was preparing him for moving out. I guess that reflects my priorities. She partly rejects it because her highest priority is for him to get a car so that she can be relieved of having to drive out to Lake Wylie twice a day 4 times a week.</li>
<li>Having a car scares the shit out of me because it will make it so easy for him to do what he did last night.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="my-boundaries">My boundaries?</h1>
<p>:boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will not live in a house where there are guns</li>
<li>I will not live in a house where there is violence or the threat of violence</li>
<li>it is not acceptable for a house guest to return home after 10 pm except by prior arrangement</li>
<li>Sean is a guest in my home. I recognize that he something other, i.e. family, for Mary Pat. That is a potential source of conflict.</li>
<li>It is unacceptable for a drug addict living as a guest in my home to not be working a program for sobriety, including meetings and a sponsor</li>
<li>a guest in my home does not have the right to demand of anyone the terms of his living arrangements – it’s a gift, not a right.</li>
<li>It is very difficult emotionally for me to witness other people exploiting Mary Pat. Sometimes I need to hold back. But sometimes I think it is appropriate for me speak out. When? How to know?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cheap-grace">Cheap grace</h1>
<p>“Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate. –<em>Dietrich Bonhoeffer</em>”</p>
<h1 id="why-not-family">Why not “family?”</h1>
<p>In the midst of nap or somewhere, and after hearing Mary Pat seemingly really strike a note against me for not treating Sean as family when I did with so many others, I realized that there was a distinguishing characteristic – a striking one!</p>
<p>In none of the other relationships was one of us in a long-term relationship with the person. Mary Pat has a 42 year relationship with Sean.</p>
