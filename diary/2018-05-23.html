<h1 id="strange-dream-in-vegas-strange-dream-in-vegas">Strange dream in Vegas {#Strange dream in Vegas}</h1>
<p>Such a strange dream to wake up with. The dream had covered territory in some way whereby I had been an adulterer -- a cheater -- with a woman. Precisely what I did not feel at all with Mary Pat. Then I was with, I think, Mary Pat, although there a kind of tinge of other women that I have known. I was happy with Mary Pat.</p>
<p>Then the final episode. We had a car and we had somewhere we needed to be. We were in an urban kind of place -- a kind of mix of Lakewood, growing up, and Vegas which is outside our window. I left Mary Pat somewhere to go get the car and pick her up. While doing that I got lost. I was almost there when I pulled into a parking lot to get my bearings. Suddenly something came flying in through the window to land on my lap as I sat behind the steering wheel. I frantically tried to identify it and then get rid of it. It was a <span id="pig"></span><strong>pig</strong>! I threw it onto the street. Then someone came up, knocking on my window. It seemed like he was the owner of the little grocery store I was parked near. With my engine running, obviously wanting to leave, he asked who I was. I told him my name and he said, &quot;OK and walked away.&quot; At that point a woman came running up to pick up the pig and hugged and kissed him like an injured child of the family. Then I woke up.</p>
