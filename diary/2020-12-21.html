<h1 id="last-words">Last words</h1>
<p>Pretty close to the last words I spoke last night before going to sleep was to Mary Pat. I said, “I feel pretty much like Rex.” Her question had been something about Christmas presents. I feel deeply inadequate that I am at an utter loss as to gifts for Mary Pat and Sean.</p>
<p>I said what I did about Rex because of the powerful portrayal of a father who fucked up on a grand scale but who was also appreciated and loved on an epic scale. I thought, “My fuck ups are petty compared to his. But my love has been epic.”</p>
<p>But I am plum out of that father’s love. Sean’s presence drives me crazy. He gets chosen to go to the grocery. He get’s chosen to help in the kitchen. He is the model for the meat and potatoes meals MP fixes. I detest his presence in the living room with the two of us.</p>
<p>Am I proud of that? No. But it’s very real for me. “What are you doing about it?”, MP asked. How do you change what you feel?</p>
<p>The other “unspoken” way in which I feel like Rex I haven’t even written about these past months. Ezra Pound stopped talking for years on end after his incarceration. Rex’s transition to dying was accompanied by ceasing to talk. Both of the men had used verbal communication in powerful ways to live their life. But they came to a point where it was time to just stop.</p>
<p>I have felt that a lot with Mary Pat. I get shut-out and dismissed. There is no solution to my talking. I have tried and tried to reach out to my children – to be a father. But it’s a brick wall. How much or why Bridget sabotaged my relationship doesn’t matter any more. The pain of these months has been marked not just by Sean’s presence, but also by the awakened hope in the communication from Emma. But she has slammed the door; so once again I am left with the feeling that it is a lot like a child has been kidnapped – Boko Haram in Nigeria – and my children are lost.</p>
<p>Once upon a time I thought there was grace and significance to my parental love. I don’t any more. Julian is precious but so far away. Miriam and her children are a soft spot for me, but for them I am just a crusty character from an old newspaper. The rest want nothing to do with me.</p>
