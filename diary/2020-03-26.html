<p>Give us this day:</p>
<p>Hence, brethren, if we wish to reach the very highest point of humility and to arrive speedily at that heavenly exaltation to which ascent is made through the humility of this present life, we must by our ascending actions erect the ladder Jacob saw in his dream, on which Angels appeared to him descending and ascending. By that descent and ascent we must surely understand nothing else than this, that we descend by self-exaltation and ascend by humility. And the ladder thus set up is our life in the world, which the Lord raises up to heaven if our heart is humbled. For we call our body and soul the sides of the ladder, and into these sides our divine vocation has inserted the different steps of humility and discipline we must climb. [<em>Rule</em> ch. 7]</p>
<p>Note how Bernard of Clairvaux was just writing a commentary on this chapter. I had just quoted this in my conversation with Janey 2 days ago. Being somewhere on the ladder is a mark of call to ordination?</p>
<p>Today in Give us this day was Walter Hilton. I chuckled remembering my project with re. the 4 English mystics: Hilton, author of the Cloud, Rolle, Marjorie Kemp. Was that when I first became aware of Julian? About that time, anyway, as I memorized <em>The Wasteland</em>.</p>

<li>email to missing class individuals. It brought in 2 more students. Peter seemed glad to get my information re. what I had to report.</li>
<li>we did Zoom contemplative bible study went tolerably well. Seemingly the way each of my zoom sessions. It has been better than nothing. Different from being in person. But tolerable.</li>
<li>Took a good walk. MP and I had a short walk.</li>
<li>Today US corona cases surpassed China's.</li>

<p>The &quot;On Being&quot; podcast I listened to was about a person who recently published a book, <em>Delight</em>. Ross Gay <em>Tending Joy and Practicing Delight</em>. It was so inspiring for me.</p>
<p>The book was born out of a pledge to himself on a birthday that each day for a year, until his next birthday, he would write about what had &quot;delighted&quot; him on that particular day.</p>
<p>I thought, &quot;I could do that.&quot; The discipline about writing I can well relate to. Vary the assignment? As I walked it occurred to me that a variation for me is the concept of knowing what we don't know. It is in the blanks. I thought of Leonard Cohen's &quot;the crack is for letting the light in.&quot; What surprised me? What do I need to know about? What is still something that I don't know but want to know?</p>
<p>What am I blind to in myself?</p>
<p>Could I do that?</p>

<p>In today's reading from Give us this day we have John Climacus. This is the oldest, I guess, use of the metaphor, predating that noted above.</p>
<p>Monk (Seventh Century)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. John Climacus, a Byzantine monk, is remembered for having popularized the image of the ladder as a symbol of the spiritual life. His treatise, The Ladder [Greek = Klimax] to Paradise, became a classic work of monastic spirituality, and it also supplied the name by which he is remembered.</p>
