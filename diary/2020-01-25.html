<ul>
<li>How Mom meet George. Calhoun. George had moved to area because of him and he set out to connect Helen and George</li>
<li>Mom was different then. She took me to see <em>A Patch of Blue</em>? Karla remembered her being very different. Bill remembered smoking pot with her and also she chastised David who snitched on some neighbor kids who were smoking pot in the park</li>
<li>Apparently the divorce happened later than I remember. Before Bill broke his leg -- 4th-5th grade -- but when David was 3-4 y/o.</li>
<li>Walt proposed to mom. Bill had responded that he would leave if she married him. Is he the airport guy?</li>
<li>Karla &amp; Bill met 6th grade.</li>
<li>Shirley &amp; I in 3/4 grade combined. Only later did I learn of the problems Mom went through over Shirley.</li>
