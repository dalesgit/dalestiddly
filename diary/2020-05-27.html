<h1 id="funeral-at-st.pauls-funeral-at-st.pauls">Funeral at St. Paul's {#Funeral at St. Paul’s}</h1>
<p>Died end of March. Ashes at funeral home in Monroe. Family is in Virginia, one in Atlanta. Widow needs closure. Former parishioners. Died Sunday. Niche in Columbarium. Tue/Wed or Fri/Sat afternoon graveside service. They have sister in Hawai'i.</p>
<p>Do Wednesday at 2pm. 10 is the max.</p>
<p>Charlotte will get the ashes. Give me Judy's contact info. So contact. &quot;Jim feels better to have him in the niche.&quot;</p>
<p>Melinda was involved as power of attorney over another one. Almost threw away a vase -- that had ashes of Kay's.</p>
<p>Fr. Jim got a Cat scan last week. Doctor wanted both of them to have a virus test -- they saw things that looked like Covid-19. Both came back negative. Still don't know what the &quot;spot&quot; is. Surgeon has told him that they don't want to operate. Too invasive. Radiation likely the response.</p>
<p>He is still planning to return on schedule. May call me for 21st. He has been gaining strength, but still weak.</p>

<li>there's a part of me that looks and feels like low-level depression</li>
<li>I trouble-shot some audio problems in my Chromebook</li>

<ul>
<li>Recorded my sermon. It was basically doable. Technically it leaves a lot to be desired. + Bob's isn't that great but he's been doing it for over 10 years.</li>
<li>agreed to a funeral next week and another Sunday service at St Paul's</li>
<li>Prepared a document for Nicci to go with Trinity Sunday</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="online-work-online-work">Online work {#Online work}</h1>
<ul>
<li>Looked at the graded pieces in Online course -- finally I saw some feedback. Corrected one thing.</li>
<li>Now I'm thinking I need to press a lot more &quot;content&quot; -- even as I think the facilitator saw that I was kind of ahead of the game.</li>

<h1 id="using-rclone-to-sync-googledrive-using-rclone-to-sync-googledrive">Using rclone to sync Googledrive {#Using rclone to sync Googledrive}</h1>
<p>Two notes in <span id="Joplin"></span><strong>Joplin</strong> that describe how to get a working sync going with GoogleDrive using <span id="rclone"></span><strong>rclone</strong> and <span id="cron"></span><strong>cron</strong>. I really think I should set it up on the back computer where the computer is on e.g. at midnight everyday.</p>
