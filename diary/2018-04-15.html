<h1 id="return-to-monroe-return-to-monroe">Return to Monroe {#Return to Monroe}</h1>
<p>It is scary considering the depth of enthusiasm my presence has generated in Monroe and last week at Our Savior. People saying things like, &quot;Best ever&quot; and so on. I am scared I can live up to the expectations, that the bubble will pop, that I will be exposed for who I am.</p>
<p>But I think of, e.g.Â Bishop Steve Charleston (sp?) and his white pony tail and his humility which combines with a determined pride in his indigenous heritage.</p>

<p>He wanted to let me know about Mo -- which I already knew -- but more details about Shirley's escapades. He has had conversations through Paul -- I pointed to the fact that Shirley deals with us through triangulating Paul. He learned that Shirley didn't invite Bridget, but he defended the propriety of their contacting all of my kids, saying, &quot;They're adults.&quot;</p>
<p>Bill was so upset he reported to David (and me) that he was not going to invite Shirley to the funeral.</p>
