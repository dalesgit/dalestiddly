<p>Yesterday was Sunday. Preaching at St. Peter's. I got part of the way through my text which had gone through at least 3 drafts and there was a part that I had not revised. I was panicky inside, thinking that the version that had downloaded onto the iPad for delivery's sake was corrupted. I was scared to follow the text from then on. I felt hampered and constricted. The text was Amos and Luke 8.</p>
<p>Later Mary Pat (at Barb's) was concerned with Mary Magdalene, Mary Bethany, and sinful woman anointing Jesus' feet -- all of them conflated in the western tradition until Paul VI -- Mary Magdalene appears also in Luke 8.</p>
<p>It turned out, as Cindy said at St. Peter's, that the best part of the day for her was my spontaneous proclamation after we finished mass, that the dismissal at St. Peter's is the best I had experienced at any church in the diocese, large or small. When we announced, &quot;Let us go forth in the name of Christ&quot; that's what we did. Every other place it was muddied by my struggle to manipulate my words of dismissal to actually be the last words of the liturgy.</p>
<p>Cindy appreciated that, I think, as a concrete illustration of my claim that Jesus' admonition to us was directed at large or small churches, but was to do one thing and to do it well, with love. (I could have quoted the song from Donovan that is a part of my monthly readings from Northumbria.) As it was I quoted Judy Small's &quot;One Voice&quot; which Mary Pat liked.</p>
