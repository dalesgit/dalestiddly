<p>We have arrived in Naples. The sun is rising over water as I look out the lanai window. It is finally comfortable, mostly feeling like we are home. We are just the two of us. We are not staying at someone's house that I don't really know. Martha and Mike were friendly enough, but whether it was Mike's seeming intense shyness or Martha's OCD, they seemed uncomfortable with these two strangers in their midst, even though Martha and Mary Pat are cousins.</p>
<p>We came fairly close to buying a house in their neck of the woods. At least both MP and I backed away from it, just on prudence grounds. We learned, though, that we don't really have enough financial resources to buy a second home without really stretching our money reserves.</p>
<p>We celebrating my dinner at a strip mall restaurant, &quot;The Mystic Fish&quot;, that was actually a very nice place with good food, well-presented. I over tipped by accident. Today it is church in a very affluent Episcopal congregation.</p>

<p>I bring you a voice from your past. Dale Hathaway, at one time from St.Â Andrew's by the Lake in Michigan City. I spent 13 years in Hawai'i and retired from parish ministry in 2012. Since that time I have been teaching in several universities, the last of which is in South Carolina. My wife has just retired from teaching and she and I are spending October in Florida. We may be moving here in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>I wanted to get in touch with you while we were visiting, but my reason for writing has snuck up on me. We went to church this morning at Trinity by the Cove in Naples. In quite a few ways it was an awesome morning and I was impressed by the breadth of ministry going on there. The organ was beautiful and the sermon was -- well, my wife turned to me and said, &quot;When did you write that sermon.&quot; I chided the preacher (Zimmerman) that his name must be Habbakuk. (He didn't get it.)</p>
<p>So, here's my question. Are all the churches in your diocese like Trinity? Jocularity aside, if some possibility presents itself, I would value having conversation with you. Currently I am supplying as often as I choose to in the dioceses of North Carolina and Upper South Carolina. We live in interesting times.</p>
<p>Aloha and Shalom, Dale C. Hathaway +</p>

<p>ca. 6pm I made a 30 minute bike ride. Went straight out to the coast. A beach on the gulf. The sun was setting. The colors, the people walking slowly, peacefully, it all was calming and peaceful. I was glad I was there.</p>
