<p>We've talked some more last night. She had started to share with Annie and recognized that her responses had sabotaged things. She wouldn't share the info with me, in part because she assumed that I would not go with her to Dayton. We needed to clarify what I would or wouldn't do. She processed incorrectly what I had said when she pressured me to get a decision about cataract surgery within 24 hours -- a &quot;transaction&quot; for something. I tried to pull us away from what &quot;was said&quot; to what the circumstances are now.</p>
<p>It was hard. I don't know how much progress we might have made. I encouraged kindness and gentleness on one another when there are known forces pushing us to friction and conflict. I told her that because of my intentions and because of my frequent use of *<span id="irony"></span><strong>irony</strong>* that she should assume with everything I say that my intentions are good and positive.</p>
<p>So much is colored for her by the deep avoidance of conflict in her family. For her it is associated primarily with her mother, who became angry and then beat her.</p>
<p>The whole situation has become acute for us to deal with because of the need for me to respond to St.Â Paul's, Monroe. I'm there first choice to care for them as their rector begins a *very serious round of surgery and chemo-therapy related to a rare and deadly cancer. I am being asked to be present as much as possible for at least 5 months.</p>
<p>Irony? that my big impediment to travel this next season is <span id="not"></span><strong>not</strong> my teaching, it will be my commitment to the church.</p>
