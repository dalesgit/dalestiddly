<h1 id="Yesterday">Yesterday</h1>
<ul>
<li>finished and posted exam. The day before I had ended up deciding that I would register for the online training -- even though I don't want to teach online. I don't believe the learning -- at least for my classes -- is there. Main goal is to open minds to new possibilities. That can't happen online I think.</li>
<li>I finished grading the Sunflower paper. The rubrics helped a lot. I first gave grades I thought they ought to get with a first reading, based in part on being very generous. Then I went through my rubrics and it was pretty close. Perhaps I ought to have more than 4 rubrics?</li>
<li>On my walk I listened to Padraic and it was amazing. The lecture was the 2nd on theodicy. Learned some things and knew enough to be critical of some things.</li>
<li>We're going to grocery this morning and then I have a Zoom clericus.</li>
<li>It feels more of the same descent into chaos as SC is opening up lots of businesses today.</li>
<li>Charlotte had called and I have dates to serve at Monroe most weekends into June.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="this-morning-this-morning">This morning {#This morning}</h1>
<ul>
<li>Together we went to Publix</li>
<li>1½ hour Zoom with clericus. Notes in Checkvist.</li>
<li>deposited $ in bank</li>
<li>Fetched things from my office. I brought home:
<ul>
<li>Papua NG bag -- first time used as bag because I didn't have any containers</li>
<li>Jewish Study Bible</li>
<li>Borges' <em>Labyrinths</em></li>
<li>Percy's <em>Message in a Bottle</em></li>
<li>Chocolates and Cheddar Fish</li>
<li>DVD's</li>
</ul></li>
