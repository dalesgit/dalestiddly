<p>Last night before bed was a struggle. I had palpitations and dizziness. I took my EKG and it indicated &quot;possible Atrial Fibrillation&quot;. It lingered for quite a while. I recorded here how Bill has had some good interaction with Shirley. It would have to wait, I told him. I felt a <span id="tinge"></span><strong>tinge</strong> of envy that Bill was getting to experience some important intensity with regard to the family. I felt []{#left out}<strong>left out</strong>.</p>
