<p>It was so vivid as I struggled to sleep through this night of fits and turns that Mom was alive and kicking and most eager to talk to me. She called while we were on some adventure in the mountains. It really seemed as if Mary Pat was there, but there was climbing, ice and snow, and danger from weather. We were with some people, finally huddled in a cabin or some such. The phone rang and I tried to answer it. All I got out of it was Mom's voice on the other end saying, &quot;Oh, I just don't know how this thing works.&quot;</p>
<p>I struggled to find a way to call her back. But it was frustrated with people fighting for the bathroom, some unintended nakedness I think.</p>

<p>#grief Shirley has reached out to Emma re. Carolyn etc. Miriam knows that Shirley has reached out to Bridget. Mary Pat wants nothing to do with grandkids if Bridget is a grandmother. I agree.</p>
<p>The movie we watched <em>Wind River</em>. I could relate to the fathers trying to deal with the grief of having lost their daughter. The one father said that you have face the pain so that you don't lose all your memories. The pain will always be there.</p>
<p>Bridget saw my mother 3 times in her life. She rejected her. She guarded the girls from her -- impact of Shirley? And then Bridget has cut off the girls from their father.</p>
<p>[]{#Do I cut myself off from one daughter because she continues to relate to that woman?}<strong>Do I cut myself off from one daughter because she continues to relate to that woman?</strong></p>

<p>Late in the evening I tried calling the nursing station but they didn't answer.</p>
