<p>About 3 hours cleaning the house. I had spent time in dreaming last night thinking of how I wanted to vacuum the corners and odd areas with the brush and the hose. I've never done that, but it got lots of hair and other stuff accumulated on the edges. I steamed the tile and vacuumed much of the carpet. I moved the large sofa slightly.</p>
<p>I spent 20-30 minutes in Zoom with my class. The report is in Checkvist. I felt uncoordinated as I began because I hadn't tested the Android interface.</p>
<p>Went to the liquor store. Washing hands frequently and trying to slalom my way around the Corona virus. I only Â½ fictitiously said that I felt safer because I was surrounded by alcohol.</p>
