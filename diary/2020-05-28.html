<p>Tubby Leitner's mother died at 104. Son and daughter attend Our Saviour. (Janey)</p>
<p>Bill Greely is planning to re-open according to phase -- but will continue to Zoom for those who are uncomfortable with fact to face.</p>
<p>Gordon is going to continue with a drive-in.</p>
<p>Bill skipping phase 1-2 and have training for congregation. Sally also is skipping to phase 3.</p>
<p>Bp. W. got idea for communion from Sally's proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;If fewer than 10 and at least 10' apart, then no masks neede.&quot; Bp. W.</p>
<p>Sally may go to &quot;online&quot; on a <span id="permanent"></span><strong>permanent</strong> basis. Watch on their schedule.</p>
<p>Bill reports that Comporium made a wireless extension from Parish Hall to Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Sally going on vacation next week.</p>
<p>June 5-8 Janey is moving to being out of contact for 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Janey (Our Saviour) is planning to ask for a kind of modest National Cathedral video set-up. All the churches planning to do online permanently. Our Saviour is reaching far and wide every night with an online Compline prayer.</p>
<p>Janey related how important it was to field questions from the vestry directed at the bishop. She learned much of the anxiety that she wouldn't have known.</p>
<p>&quot;We are currently at 10 limit for attendance.&quot; (Phase 1)</p>
<h1 id="my-time-at-our-saviour-my-time-at-our-saviour">My time at Our Saviour {#My time at Our Saviour}</h1>
<p>Record it first? Zoom at church? This Sunday Janey will be at altar officiating with Bp. preaching. She will be behind altar (out of ordinary). Again on 7th. Chip could let me in. She has been Zooming from a laptop. Missal stand for binder. What about iPad? Could I use phone. Backup is Facebook Live -- Chip would take over at that point -- if Zoom went down. Only 2 and distance means no mask. Anne logs in participants at 10:15. Meet Chip &amp; ? have a dry-run, week of 8th or 7th. Janey will email us and we will work it out.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 Zoom sessions, phone call Janey, phone call to wido in Virginia re. funeral</li>
<li>recorded another round of the sermon on iphone.</li>
<li>went to CVS / liquor store</li>
<li>went for walk</li>
<li>In some ways the most satisfying of all was serendipitous. I went out to the garage looking in bins I hadn't searched before. I was looking for a tripod, trying to sort out the possibilities for recording sermons. I knew I had a unipod -- and I found that. No tripod. But I found a bunch of electronic, audio, video, stuff. Also the old analog scale. I took it apart, put it together, and it works -- sort of. Also I found my old keyboard. 20 years old maybe. I had got a midi interface late in the game. I plugged it in and it worked right off the bat. It's better than the newer one I dug out some weeks ago. Satisfying.</li>
