<p>Finished editing the sermon. Practiced several times trying to find the best way to keep eye contact with my recordings. Recorded the Monroe version. Settled on Macbook Air for Church of Our Saviour. I think a sticky note is a good reminder and prompt.</p>
<p>Finished up the prep for the &quot;Plan-it&quot; for Module penultimate. Virtually submitted the &quot;Getting Started.&quot;</p>
<p>Returned the UPS package.</p>
<p>Kept Lectio appointment. Olga-Marie was very insensitive to Mary Pat and pandered to me. I didn't respond well.</p>
