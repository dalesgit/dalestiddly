<h1 id="how-could-miriam">How could Miriam</h1>
<p>I just really don’t get how Miriam go to the wedding and not tell me. And all the other times. Linda S. uses the phrase that my authenticity depends on “showing up.” How do I do that when my children have worked so hard to build walls to keep me out?</p>
<p>Children hurt so much.</p>
<h1 id="zoom-with-student-rascals">Zoom with student rascals</h1>
<p>Ah, I guess it went well.</p>
<h1 id="psalm-31">Psalm 31</h1>
<p><sup>9</sup> Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am in distress; My eye is wasted away from grief, my soul and my body also.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup> For my life is spent with sorrow And my years with sighing; My strength has failed because of my iniquity, And my body has wasted away.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup> Because of all my adversaries, I have become a reproach, Especially to my neighbors, And an object of dread to my acquaintances; Those who see me in the street flee from me.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup> I am forgotten as a dead man, out of mind; I am like a broken vessel.</p>
<p><a href="http://commonprayer.net/11/06#more-2457">common prayer psalm</a> is dramatic and overwrought, but I identified with it, as I have woke this morning asking myself how could Miriam go to the wedding and not let me know? I shared with MP that it is a similar feeling to reckoning with the fact that a huge swath of the country thinks that racism is ok, mockery of handicapped, etc.</p>
<p>As I read the psalm I wondered whether I should send it to Miriam? Emma? To what end? What do I seek from the two of them?</p>
