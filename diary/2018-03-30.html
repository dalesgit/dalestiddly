<p>Our home for 3 days is a motel room. Happily it's fairly nice, with a hide-a-bed and a soft chair and coffee table. My liturgies have been well-received. Mary Pat said that she felt like crying several times during today's liturgy. I had a sense that there was a solemnity and an awareness of God's presence that was palpable. I'm grateful.</p>
