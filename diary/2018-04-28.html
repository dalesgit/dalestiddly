<p>Nick is in California. burying his mother in law. Back &quot;mid to late May&quot;.</p>

<p>Paul called him. I was angry for a few moments at Paul insisting on doing a communication via triangulation. I really detest that man. Shirley later finally responded to the email and she didn't respond to my questions but instead offered her magnanimous gift of offering to share the Air B n B. Logan is not leaving until the 23rd. Bill &amp; Karla likely leaving Tuesday to return to Flagstaff. He would allow a few days before funeral to work on house.</p>
<p>His call with Paul showed that Logan and Katrina are interested in coming and their spouses are question marks but it would be better for them if it was the weekend. Suzanne is in Delaware. Stephen is in Maryland.</p>
<p>We settle on May 19.</p>
<p>Nick has corresponded with me and confirms May 19 on the church calendar. The interim will apparently be in charge at that point.</p>
