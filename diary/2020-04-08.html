<ul>
<li>finished and posted 2 presentations</li>
<li>graded ½ of the Sunflower discussion. Mostly disappointed with their lack of grounding in the text</li>
<li>hosted Zoom. Gave them 1 week extension and offered my help to link up students for the collaboration part of the paper. Exam stays on course.</li>
<li>Walked. Padrè and <em>Poetry Unbound</em> was about Caregivers. And then the elaborate beauty of the &quot;bog&quot; in an Irish poet's small piece.</li>
<li>Frank Chun called during walk.</li>
<li>strange movie with Elizabeth Moss. <em>The one I love</em>. I think I should look into <em>On Being</em> blogs: <em>Becoming Wise</em> and <em>Movies that changed me</em>.</li>
