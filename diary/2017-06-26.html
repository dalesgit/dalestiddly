<p>==First full day with Miriam== Lee seemed to indicate that leaving the area was at least a possibility if he gets advancement.</p>
<p>Will is such a strictly articulate little man.</p>
<p>What I wanted to write was in addition to the insight I recorded earlier about recognizing that Owen, Julian, Miriam were intent on respecting the radical individuality of the various members. So, Julian wants to respect Lydia, Emma as well as Bridget. No principles of right and wrong. Relativism is paramount.</p>
<p>Mary Pat adds an important issue that I also stumbled into the other day. I said that in my family -- for all its dysfunction -- did not know about the radical shunning that Emma (Lydia) have engaged in at the prompting of Bridget. Only with Bridget's entry into the system did it start.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bridget &amp; Sean</li>
<li>Dee/Da &amp; their son</li>
<li>Bridget's attitude toward her 1st husband</li>
<li>Shirley &amp; Bridget united in hatred of me</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Mary Pat observed that the thing that united the people gathered in Portland was me. But my guess is that no one mentioned me -- that I was off limits to talk about. I was what no one talked about. The dinosaur in the room</p>
<p>But maybe that's being too presumptuous.</p>
