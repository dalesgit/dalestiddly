<li>I'm sure you are aware that you didn't do well on your exam. This result doesn't have to be a disaster for your grade. It can very well be a wake-up call to success. Please come to see me during my office hours or contact me to make an appointment for another time. I would like to talk with you about what you can do to succeed in the future in our class.</li>
<li>One key to success is to recognize that if you do <span id="something"></span><strong>something</strong> in the essay questions you will get credit. Most of the poor results were associated with exams with no response to a question. []{#I gave you the questions. You knew a week ahead of time.}<strong>I gave you the questions. You knew a week ahead of time.</strong></li>
<li>One surprise for me was the generally poor performance on the vocabulary items. Some missed <span id="zero"></span><strong>zero</strong>. But many missed 8, 9, 10 or more. Again, you knew a week in advance the items that would be on the exam. I told you where to find the answers in two books.</li>
<li>Review the rubrics for exam. Illustrate the 4 point checklist.</li>
<li>Method was to average 5 grades: 1 for vocabulary, 4 essays.</li>
<li>Basic importance: I am not looking for a reflection on &quot;what you think or feel about a subject.&quot; I am looking for evidence that you have been listening, that you read, that you have been thinking about the material. An example is: we have repeated over and over that <span id="religion"></span><strong>religion</strong> does not necessarily have to do with God, church, worship -- though that may be your experience of it. Religion has been defined for us as having to do with the <span id="sacred"></span><strong>sacred</strong> and how it works in human lives and how it is manifest in human lives.</li>
