<p>I spent some time putting together a few themes surrounding Ascension. My idea was to do overview of that and then share my response from first Father and then Mother after death, revealing that the message in both cases was &quot;I'm ok.&quot; Then to invite the listeners to share as called.</p>
<p>As seems to have happened over and over again, the people listening to me here in this neck of the woods seem to be blown away by my ministry with them. &quot;You are such a breath of fresh air,&quot; I have heard over and over again.</p>
<p>I'm humbled. I don't think it's really me doing it, though I recognize the freedom I feel in being retired. I'm grateful. It's the Lord doing the work.</p>
