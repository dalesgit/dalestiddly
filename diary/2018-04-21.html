<p>In the afternoon a surprise call. He has only been out of the hospital for about a week. He had pneumonia and collapsed while he was in the doctor's office. They said he was within hours or even minutes of dying. He doesn't remember anything past getting into the ambulance.</p>
<p>He is open to meeting this summer for a stay in Sedona. He would drive.</p>
