<p>I’m awake after only 4 hours. I guess I feel depressed. I feel angry. I feel like throwing in the towel. FEAR: fuck everything and run.</p>
<p>I despise living in this household with Sean. Why? I guess because of what it has meant for the relationship with Mary Pat.</p>
<p>She threatened leaving the other day when Sean opened his talk and I introduced the concept of trying to work together with A or B or C. MP began again with the threat 2 days ago. She wanted to have a conversation about Sean. She was cooking. “Would I be willing to have a conversation while I’m cooking. (And she was leaving fairly quickly to go pick him up.)” She ended up objecting to my suggestion that the starting point for room and board was the going rate.</p>
<p>She wanted to argue against me. The thrust of her argument was that I was being too demanding. That it would be difficult.</p>
