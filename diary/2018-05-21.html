<p>We've returned for a day before we head out for &quot;vacation.&quot; The dreams included the likes of George Clooney and various family members.</p>
<p>Especially burning with me was the exchange with David's Charlotte. It felt like she was almost attacking me. The charge being too focused on self and not turning &quot;outward&quot;. It was in the context of trying to respond to Hale's request to talk privately with me and being constantly interrupted. But I had just made the connection between Charlotte and Hale when she complained of so much loss in her life -- a kind of []{#poor me}<strong>poor me</strong>.</p>
<p>I think she wasn't directing it so much at me. But later I learned that Shirley had been spreading her venom about mom -- and presumably other members of the family -- to anyone who would listen: Dylan, Mary &amp; Charlotte, Martha, ...</p>
<p>I am numb to David's enthusiasm about he thinks that Emma is ready to approach me. He made the claim that she had tickets to the funeral but wasn't able to use them because something came up. That whole story feels like it's only partly true.</p>
<p>But the whole thing leaves me numb. I had said in response to a conversation about the girls someday finding me that none of us has all kinds of time to do stuff that needs to be done. All of us only have one day, I said, &quot;today.&quot;</p>
<p>I feel bitter, I guess, over all the time that has been wasted, never to be recovered. We only have today. I know it's a lesson to me, as well. If they approach me, even on a death bed, or after death, I will forgive them and receive them like a &quot;prodigal father.&quot;</p>
<p>But, but, but ...</p>

<p>Sometime in the last couple days, Julian was responding to Mary Pat I think about traveling out of the country. This was in anticipation of family going to Sophie's wedding set for later in the summer or early fall, set to take place on this big island off the coast of New Brunswick, near Maine. Julian said that he had a passport, left over from traveling to Thailand, but that it had expired many years ago.</p>
<p>I laughed and expressed surprise and delight that he and I had the same recurring dream/nightmare. He didn't seem to pay much notice to it. But it seemed so significant to me.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lord, for the gift.</p>
