<p>Taking to heart Linda’s insight about Mary Pat’s happiness.</p>
<h3 id="daily-affirmation">Daily affirmation</h3>
<p>The women martyrs from central America. Yoo So let MP know about them.</p>
<p><em>Wendell Berry</em> to go in the dark with a light is to know the light. to know the dark, go dark. go without light, and find that the dark, too, blooms and sings, and is traveled by dark feet and dark wings.</p>
<h3 id="three-things-that-happened-today">Three things that happened today:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Made progress in 317 discussions</li>
<li>chatted with 101 and Tina said it was her favorite class</li>
<li>I resigned myself to Mary Pat’s and Sean’s proposal for $800 rent</li>
<li>Learned about Mermaid graphic language</li>
<li>I tried to discern Peter’s request for my intentions about teaching next fall. My body seems to tell more yes. I put it off.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-could-i-have-made-today-better">How could I have made today better?</h3>
<p>What is the source of my grumpiness when it comes to anything having to do with Sean?</p>
<p>Rene’s boyfriend in Honolulu elicited more compassion than Sean and he had been a murderer at San Quentin.</p>
<p>Earlier I has stopped short in the phrase, every aspect of of life is controlled by Sean and has needs.</p>
