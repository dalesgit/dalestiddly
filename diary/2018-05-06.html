<h1 id="moms-funeral-a-dream-moms-funeral-a-dream">Mom's funeral: a dream {#Momâ€™s funeral: a dream}</h1>
<p>Woke from dream contented and floating toward a good place. A little bit, I guess, like last night's movie &quot;Places of the Heart.&quot;</p>
<p>I wanted to put Mom's young portrait as a nurse on the cover of the funeral bulletin. Bill nixed it. He has other ideas -- and he's the one making decisions. Walking, I listened to Nitty Gritty Dirt Band playing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; -- I thought that would meet some of my requirements for a song to sing. The President led the nation in singing that! I thought. Their next song about living in a mansion, or making home where you make it, or love is the only thing that endures -- these were candidates for music to accompany the funeral.</p>
