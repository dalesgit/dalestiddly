<h1 id="birthday-reflections">Birthday reflections</h1>
<p>Waking after everyone is up. Sean is off early to work again. I thought about how I am reluctant to go downstairs in Dayton, or even more so when we are staying with people at a timeshare.</p>
<p>It made me think that Sean is like a timeshare invitee. He’s like family. Family I don’t get along with, but family anyway. I could have a better attitude if I just knew how long the sentence was for. In the analogies it is a matter of days. In Sean’s case it has already been months and seems likely to stretch into years. And it just depresses the shit out of me.</p>
<p>It’s my birthday. There’s an unidentified package in the living room. In my dreams I was in Hawai’i. The dream of having to leave wasn’t there, but there was a bittersweet tone. In one I woke up enough to think about and I reflected, dreamlike, that, “Oh, I didn’t live there anymore.” Leaving was like leaving home.</p>
<p>I’ve thought a few times in the past days that I would like to have my ashes spread there. I don’t really care where they go, but it would be kind of my last message from this life, that Hawai’i was truly home.</p>
<p>I said to Mary Pat yesterday, in a conversation that was heated because of a series of misunderstandings – we each misinterpret the other – I said in response to something or other from her about where we’d be in 20 years, that I didn’t have 20 years.</p>
<p>I wrote the piece to Mary Pat in Zettl, trying to exercise the principles of Zettelgasten and learning the software. I felt like I kind of got the feel for it and I produced a 1600 word letter to MP rather quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>I see that I have just, Sun Oct 04, 2020 08:32 AM, received an email from Shirley. She signs off with “your youngest sister”, making a lesson in all of it. Her report is about Suzanne and her Arthur getting old, having to move, making end of life decisions. Shirley was, “I thought would like to know.”</p>
