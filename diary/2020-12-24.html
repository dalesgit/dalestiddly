<p>Christmas 2020 poem</p>
<p>The watchman watches for a sign To warrant wrangling hope From the restless marauding present. The prophet sees into the signs of the times To recognize whence and whither we walk this way Today.</p>
<p>Our presence is built on the backs of a multitude, Seers, pastors, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, Stretching back eons and reaching the stars.</p>
<p>We watched a confluence of stars (not), But wandering planets, not since 1226, We wandered and wavered along the darkened road, Like magi on a mission they scarcely controlled, Driven like a water spout in Honolulu harbor, Toward an embrace laced with intimacy and exhaustion.</p>
<p>A baby in a manger, a musical phrase, Reds and whites, not political, but Heaven’s voice, “Fall or faint into the arms of love.” “Outside is America”, you too cry a little, Because it’s not heaven nor home, But a hospice (archaic use) where pilgrims rest Only to rejoin the walk, follow the sign, The stars (not).</p>
<p>We watch. We wait. We hope. We love. Here at the feet of the babe, The embryo of love that in time Suffuses the light of the cosmos with its love. In time, in our time, there’s time enough, But only now. It’s time. It’s Christmas I see.</p>
