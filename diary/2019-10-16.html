<p>Today we head out for our one day devoted to Disney. I'm worried about all the walking. On waking this morning I'm also worried about the sun.</p>
<p>Much of yesterday Mary Pat spent invested in her major complaint to Diamond over our treatment at Liki Tiki and the condition of the apartment. Her complaints made their way to someone who was able to just hear her out. That was helpful and Mary Pat told her that. She has offered to shampoo the carpet and give the apartment a cleaning and change of linen today while we are out.</p>
<p>We talked a good bit about Sue. MP had called her while I was taking a nap. My impression was that she did exactly the right the thing and responded exactly right. But in conversation, MP heard me voice different kind of concerns. That contributed to her getting really down on herself. She feels judgment from me and I absolutely intend none. I get confused.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>What delighted the most? The &quot;safari ride&quot; and seeing the animals.</li>
<li>What surprised the most? The delight I found in imagining myself in &quot;Pandora&quot;. It was a hokey ride but I relished the imaginings.</li>
<li>Both of the day? Clearly Amy calling to say that Patch had reminded her that she had missed my birthday. She was so sweet and loving in her best wishes and apology.</li>
<li>Learning for the day? Clerk at Diamond counter said, &quot;Really nice bike!&quot; and that led to some conversation. She said there was a good place for trails someplace not too far from here, &quot;Lakeside by ... something or other.&quot;</li>
<li>Pleasantly surprised in the day? Dabney responded to my email. We may talk a week from Friday. He is at Executive Council until then, being a very important person.</li>
