<p>We successfully hosted Peter &amp; Christina, with Patrick (Pat) and Ashley. There were some interesting moments when I felt like Peter &amp; Christina were learning things about Ashley right along with us. The couple has been together something like 5 years.</p>
<p>MP's meal was superb, up and down the menu. A lot of work went into cleaning and silver etc. But the meal was hers.</p>
<p>There was disappointing moment when she got a call from her sisters. They all talked as if nothing had changed in their relationship. MP piped in that she would put the phone on speaker &quot;so that Dale can be a part (or listen)&quot;. I felt manipulated and irritated that just like that things were to put back to normal. It seemed so false and dishonest.</p>
<p>I sent greetings to all my kids but one and to Bill and David. I received nice responses from Scott, Julian, Mo and Miriam.</p>
