<h1 id="julian-called-julian-called">Julian called {#Julian called}</h1>
<p>He was cleaning his car and had some time. He called. It was so good to connect. I ended by telling him that I loved him and I was so proud of him. I don't know if he heard me.</p>
<p>His voice, though was very upbeat. He's humming along with projects in his &quot;handyman&quot; project, but he is eager to not have to do anything for a while in the fall. Plans to visit: Miriam, Emma, &amp; David. Perhaps Mo at Ring Lake? He is also open to being with us for a period in Florida during month of October.</p>
<p>He is so dear to my heart. Mo was close enough on a walk to photo a Grizzly mom with her cubs. She traveled to Iceland to do work or training with horses. She liked it very much.</p>
<h1 id="mass-shootings-mass-shootings">Mass shootings {#Mass shootings}</h1>
<p>Yesterday had begun with the news of a mass shooting in Dayton. I delayed waking her with the news because I knew it would be so emotionally wrenching. It was. Bethy was okay, but the shooting was within blocks of where she lived. One of the safe restaurants that the removed people to was the &quot;Dublin&quot; restaurant we had eat at with her in May-June.</p>

<p>Gary is with us at our house. It's good to have a friend. I especially look forward to sharing him with Peter &amp; Christina on Tuesday.</p>
