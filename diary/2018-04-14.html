<p>In this description of Mark Zuckerberg testifying before Congress, the article makes the point that Mark needs to recognize that Facebook doesn't always work for the <span id="good"></span><strong>good</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pale and visibly uncomfortable in a dark suit instead of his regular hoodie, Zuckerberg stuck closely to company talking points. “Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company,” he told lawmakers. “For most of our existence, we focused on all the good that connecting people can do… It’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm, as well.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, Facebook didn’t have bad intentions or deliberately ignore the warnings and critics. It was simply too idealistic and too optimistic to imagine the platform being used for anything other than good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miriam has had good intentions, being on everybody's side, telling everybody, &quot;I hear your pain.&quot; Just like Facebook. It can facilitate a tragedy of epic proportions.</p>
