<h1 id="first-day-of-counseling">First day of counseling</h1>
<p>cf. notes in <em>Joplin</em></p>
<p>The day after. Awake early to go to my first counseling at 8am. Conversation of one kind or another with a pretty good range of people yesterday, the longest were phone calls with Bill and with Scott. Irony and tension. The most satisfying? Perhaps texting with Lydia and with Mo. Neither of them particularly deep but each of them felt like the other wanted to hear from me.</p>
<p>By far the most important element of the day was the incredible amount of effort that :Mary Pat: had put into the meal, the card, the overall impact of the day. It was a beautiful effort. Love.</p>
<h1 id="journaling">Journaling</h1>
<p>The counselor sent me material about journaling. I haven’t looked at it yet. But, late, after Mary Pat has gone and fetched Sean and I have retreated into the bedroom, I begin reading Sue Monk Kidd. It is her journal from when she was maybe in her 30’s. The beginning of her awakening. At the beginning she announces she wants to become a writer. She tries to divide her life into spheres and apportion out her responsibilities in each. I thought, “What she is going through is analogous to what I am going through with Sean.” He is like a child added to the family. My challenge is for finding my own space.</p>
<p>The t-shirt Mary Pat gave me says, in effect, that I have to find time for playing piano. Writing, too.</p>
<h1 id="examen">Examen</h1>
<ul>
<li>What surprised me today? That I flunked the assignment to remember 3 things at the counselors office.</li>
<li>What inspired me today? I’ve written about above.</li>
<li>What touched me today? All the people who responded to me re. my birthday. Mary Pat pointed me to it via <em>Facebook</em>©</li>
</ul>
<p>FROM CHARLES CAVE</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I enjoy doing today? Writing.</li>
<li>What would I like to more of? Piano</li>
<li>What would I like to do less of? Trying to figure out what Mary Pat’s question really is.</li>
<li>What did I learn today?</li>
<li>What will I do differently tomorrow? Tomorrow we go to visit Amy in Greenville. She and I seem to have a bond of some kind. But I feel stressed about those family bonds.</li>
