<ul>
<li>Got emacs working on the desktop. Installed evil, evil-org and it is mostly working as I would expect it.</li>
<li>made a list of the tasks that need doing. I will be able to cross them off and see what needs to be done.</li>
<li>the above makes it possible to prioritize what needs doing</li>
<li>It seems that if I have all the ducks in order, I can click it off more quickly</li>
<li>birthday gifts came for MP's birthday</li>
<li>my new kindle came. It seems way much more betta.</li>
