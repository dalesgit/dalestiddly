<p>Sam Rodman has produced a policy yesterday for the diocese that is pretty far-reaching. The only troubling part I felt had to do with his call that the clergy not participate in &quot;common cup&quot; as well as laity. I didn't know if he meant there would be no chalice on the altar. And if so how was the consecrated wine to be handled?</p>
<ul>
<li>Consecrated elements should be handled reverently. I still remember Bart DeMerchant's story about seeing an altar guild somewhere in the country taking a loaf of consecrated bread and dumping it in the trash.</li>
<li>A principle for me since seminary has been that I don't <span id="pretend"></span><strong>pretend</strong> at anything during the liturgy. If there's no water in the cruet -- don't pretend there is. If there's no bread and wine -- you go get some.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now Charlotte is ok with consuming the small amount of wine in chalice as I revest the chalice and paten. If we move to removing it to the sacristy I want there to be safe-guards that make sure it is handled and consumed reverently.</p>
<p>She is going to take care of notices to the congregation and seeing about the possibility of a notice in the bulletin.</p>
<p>She reports that the ongoing saga of the funeral has been quite something and that I should be glad I couldn't do it.</p>
