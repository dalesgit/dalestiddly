<p>In a Best Western, not much of any place to go. I am anxious about two upcoming sermons. Tonight and tomorrow morning (2). We're planning to go watch a movie that Sean had passed on to us. Named after the song, <em>I can only Imagine</em>.</p>
<p>I need to spend time on the sermons. I'm weary. Bill is weary, I think, of being the 100% goto guy for Mom. Another weekend in the hospital. I wonder how is this getting paid for? I think this is exactly what Mom didn't want for herself.</p>
<p>It's not easy getting into a creative mode when I wake up. Is it sleep fogging up my brain. When I'm really writing I can feel myself in kind of a &quot;zone.&quot; It's difficult to get into the zone when I'm not alone. It's impossible to get into it with the TV on.</p>
