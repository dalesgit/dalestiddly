<h1 id="dream-a-smashed-tv">Dream: a smashed TV</h1>
<p>Last dream followed the other end of sleep where Mary Pat was clearly interested in touching, even holding my hand. I wanted to reciprocate, but it seemed strange. As if I would ask, “Why are you doing this?” It wasn’t for sex but clearly for some kind of closeness or reassurance. On awakening in the morning Mary Pat said, “It was nice snuggling with you.”</p>
<p>So in the dream we were surrounded by a number of young people. I remember a person like Walter M. from Chaminade. But there were others. They may have been helping us or they may have been just kind of around. We seemed to be moving into this rather lovely place, a house. There was a balcony and a yard down below. A little like David’s house, I suppose, or maybe MP’s brother Joe. There were windows and light, high ceilings.</p>
<p>But the thing I ended on was saying something to MP about the TV and she indicated she was getting rid of it. It was a huge bulky thing like we got rid of in Honolulu. I was aware of thinking but not saying to MP that I was relieved to be getting rid of it.</p>
<p>Last night had been rather pleasant after Sean got back. There was no TV. We were both sewing.</p>
<p>I realized that she was probably just replacing the TV, but I was the appointed person to discard it. I asked the Walter figure and maybe other young people to help us get the very bulky and heavy thing out of the house. We lugged it out the back sliding doors, onto the balcony. I didn’t how we would get it down the ladder like descent. Walter moved it to the edge and pushed it over. It crashed to the ground. It was satisfying for me.</p>
<p>There had been a couple of young people around, like a younger Lydia and Emma.</p>
