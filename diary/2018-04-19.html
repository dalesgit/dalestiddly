<h1 id="closing-day-at-winthrop-closing-day-at-winthrop">closing day at Winthrop {#closing day at Winthrop}</h1>
<p>Last class in Modern Christian Thought. I have thought that I really let the class get away from me. It had top notch students and very under-performing students. How to get both to have a positive experience? I don't really feel good about what I have provided. I thought of this when Peter talked last night about his capstone projects with majors. They sound extraordinary. But it's not a fair comparison, of course.</p>
<p>Peter also seemed to be &quot;courting me&quot; as he talked about the possibility of providing students a &quot;pre-seminary&quot; track at WU. &quot;We could use an Episcopalian.&quot; Mary Pat said later that she thinks he would really like to have me on the faculty. That if things had gone differently I might have gone on to finish the Ph.D.Â and that she would continue teaching if I was doing something that energized me.</p>
<p>I will be said, actually, to not be teaching. Even though I experience a lot of stress from it. I would really like to stay engaged somehow. In fact, I suppose, blogging and YouTube allow for some possibility along those lines.</p>
<p>Perhaps developing an online presence that I felt good about?</p>
<h2 id="talk-with-bill-talk-with-bill">Talk with Bill {#Talk with Bill}</h2>
<p>He reports that Mom now has an MRSA infection, presumably from the catheter. Other things, kidney, are doing better. Bill &amp; Karla are now planning on going down next week. But he has to get better. Not responding to the antibiotics.</p>
<p>He points to the support that Karla can give him by being there. She's up to it.</p>
<p>I was taken by his talk about the occasion of Barbara Bush dying. Somehow I had been aware of the same age of the 2 women. Bill had listened to news about George W. going to say good bye to his mom. Bill's really wrestling with the heavy stuff.</p>
<p>He made a reference to my being with Mom when she was going through the valley of death. He said that &quot;she appreciated it.&quot; I'm not really sure what he was referring to. I'm thinking that it was my trip down before first of year.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell if maybe he was urging me to decide to go down now. Or maybe to accompany him. Just kind of a weird exchange. But big time stuff.</p>
