<p>MP read to me about an upcoming documentary by Carl Reiner, about nonogenarians like himself. He is currently writing 2 books and he has written at least 1 a year for some time. He advised people about living to an old age to have a goal when they wake up in the morning. Title of his piece, or quote, &quot;He gets up in the morning and reads the obituaries. If he's not listed then he eats breakfast.&quot;</p>
