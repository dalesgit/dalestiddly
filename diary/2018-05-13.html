<h1 id="today-was-extraordinary-today-was-extraordinary">Today was extraordinary {#Today was extraordinary}</h1>
<p>Our last day at St. Paul's was filled with emotion. I shared so many little stories with folks as we knew it was a good bye.</p>
<ul>
<li>I shared my fear and anxiety about coming up with a sermon when I knew that week after week folks were coming to me and telling me of how powerfully and personally my words were impacting them. I shared that I didn't know how I was going to try again but that somehow the words would flow and I would speak want seemed needed to speak.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I shared that I thought God acted through surprise, because we are so good at keeping God out. So on a regular basis He catches us by surprise. I said, I had not intended to fall in love with all of you. But I did.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I shared about the recent discovery of Caroline. At that a group who had banded together to convince me that the power of the St. Paul's community -- the integrity of which I had commented to Mary Pat after the first time I had come, alone without her, while she stayed at home to meet Amy after her gig in Charlotte -- the power of the community was that it was responded so powerfully to me and my ministry. After sharing with them about Caroline, they immediately toned in that they all were part of dysfunctional families. Henry commented then, that they had chosen the St. Paul's family, in part because it was so good at loving.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Manly Larry Helms seemed to be on the verge of tears several times as he processed saying goodbye. He let slip at one point that he seemed to have hope that some miraculous rearrangement would take place and I would be able to return to St. Paul's.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Another parishioner actually told Mary Pat that perhaps something would happen to the new rector and we would be able to return.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I preached on this time for them (Ascension tide) was going to be a time of moving from goodbye sadness to <span id="joy"></span><strong>joy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A gorgeous bouquet was given to us with Lilies and tulips.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Kathleen said that sometimes in her life she had a deep sense of the possibilities of a relationship -- but one that was not to be. She indicated that this was one. She had made a connection with me that was deep and that I hadn't really appreciated.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>There were 100 people at two services and it really seemed as if all 100 of them sincerely resonated with me.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>I need to send a really lovely thank you to the congregation.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Time and time again people said that there was a bonding between us that was extraordinary. &quot;A chemistry thing.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Several revealed to us today that there had been a hard time, a time of bitterness and even &quot;betrayal&quot; during Brad's last couple of years. There was time of illness, surgery and sabbatical, when the congregation felt abandoned.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Then I came along and was <span id="present"></span><strong>present</strong> to them. Some reported that most supply clergy just &quot;show up,&quot; putting in their time. I came and invested myself in them, listened to them, responded to who they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>I look at the photo directory and I feel breathless with emotion. The sadness is deep.</p>
<p>We have invested much of ourselves into the people of this community. One after another pleaded with us to come back to visit. I was asking even before today, &quot;What am I supposed to do with this reality?&quot; Should I go back into more permanent ministry? Interim ministry e.g.? Do I just record it as a verification, confirmation, of my ministry? Is it a confirmation of the missed opportunities by Bob Fitzpatrick\</p>
