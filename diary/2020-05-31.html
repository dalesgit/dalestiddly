<ul>
<li>Went through miscellaneous materials that Mary Pat had gone through, stacked in the living room. Put it into folders. Discarded much. Added 2 new boxes to my database and cataloged &quot;folders&quot; or contents.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Wrote a doable Trinity sermon -- though Mary Pat hasn't read it yet. Today I need to record it for tomorrow's taping.</li>
</ul>

<li>1½ hour &quot;social&quot; time with Judges. It was good for Mary Pat. I felt like there was much that Peter and I could have pursued, but we were cut off. We share much in terms of background experience, educational i.e. theological education. Talking with him often leaves me feeling that I'm not as much of a &quot;chump&quot; as I feel sometimes. I never got recognition for being a theologian, but there is some real depth. I guess I was led to that by an afternoon of reflection on the Trinity.</li>
<li>Peter had not heard of Catherine Lacugna -- but he felt safe in saying that he relied on Karl Rahner's <em>magnum opus</em> &quot;On the Trinity.&quot; I didn't have time to drop my own little tid-bit that I heard him speak at Marquette in 1981. Award honoring Bernard Lonergan.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>There certainly was a time when I thought that the only good thing going on in theology was Rahner.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="todays-work-todays-work">Today's work {#Today’s work}</h1>
<ul>
<li>Edited then recorded the Trinity sermon</li>
<li>Edited the Trinity template</li>
<li>Got the old scale working by lubricating and then figuring out a method for assembly</li>
<li>Assembled the spice hanger for the pantry</li>
<li>Responded to Miriam's email about Pentecost baptisms. Remember that River &amp; Will also were baptized thus. And she keeps their birthdays!</li>
<li>Shared with them the video of my Pentecost sermon.</li>
<li>Got ½ of the rclone connection to GoogleDrive working. I've got 1 way. I'll figure out the 2 way sync.</li>
