<p>Grief that is not faced through, but suppressed, will come back in haunting ways. Guilt not confessed and redeemed. #grief</p>

<p>I hope it was good to have pressed Mary Pat that I want to have explicit conversations and do with less <span id="assumptions"></span><strong>assumptions</strong> and backdoor decisions. Just a month ago I was negotiating with Peter and with my inner self about teaching. I was working on the explicit statements we had said that we would be in Rock Hill for a while.</p>
<p>Being in Florida has given Mary Pat a taste of making a change and she is thrilled.</p>
