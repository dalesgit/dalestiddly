<p>Yesterday the 7th anniversary. It was in many ways a lovely day. I pushed forward the 30 year place mat project. We had a familiar but welcome dinner at Longhorn's. We split an 8oz filet.</p>
<p>The discouraging thing was communication from Katie that she needs to talk about our planned trip to Dayton. Apparently there will be a problem with our staying at the house. Is it Beth? We don't know. But for me it's a return to what was repulsive to me before. Now to be added to Frannie's horror.</p>
<p>We also learned from neighbor Dale that all 3 trees are on his property. I don't know if contesting his surveyors is relevant or possible. He said that they had found metal marking plates with a metal detector.</p>
