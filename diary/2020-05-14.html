<p>I found references to both of them this morning. Tom was described as a &quot;potatoe farmer&quot; in the San Luis valley in a blog about the loss of nature in the rivers of the southwest. <a href="http://brucefinley.com/1995/04/" class="uri">http://brucefinley.com/1995/04/</a></p>
<p>Terry is on <em>Facebook</em> -- I recognized his face immediately. The only friend I really recognized was Sharon Sprague. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terry.milligan.1238/friends" class="uri">https://www.facebook.com/terry.milligan.1238/friends</a>. His last post was 2016.</p>
<p>cf. my reflections on teachers in my life from a few days ago, 5/11</p>
<p>From a &quot;ratemyprofessors&quot; with re. his teaching at Art Institute Sept. 2015:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mr. Terry Milligan and the classes I was able to take from him in school were, for lack of a better word, completely inspirational and unbelievably filled with information. I am certain that he has forgotten more than most of us will ever know. He was one of those teachers that inspired me to work harder at understanding why I do what I do.&quot; Terry Milligan is the best professor I ever had. He is an impressively intelligent being with lots of depth, insight and humor with an entertaining manner of teaching which makes his lectures fascinating. He spent time on each one of my written papers to make in depth comments, I always felt like he cared and had depth, I miss you Terry! Terry has a lot more information stored in his brain than anyone can comprehend. He is a wealth of knowledge that students opinions get in the way of. I found in my class the students with too strong of opinions could not focus on learning from him only arguing. I still remember 50% of the information I learned in his class 1yr later. Excellent I have no idea how the rest of these people did not like him. They obviously have not attended any other higher institutions. I loved his lectures. They were pretty cut and dry. The information presented only required you to think and not memorize information. [Terry Milligan: Professor in the Social Science department at Art Institute of Colorado]</p>
