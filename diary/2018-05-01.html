<p>Bill says to talk to Jeannie Lutz. Interim? Admin?</p>
<p>admin is eric. After got through first blast on the phone he was pleasant to talk to. Fr. Nick is officially gone either 5/6 or 5/8. Eric has made a note of pm request and is passing it on to Nick. I also asked that he request Jeannie to contact me.</p>
<p>Interim: Jeannie Lutz. she's a long-time member of community but never serving in official capacity at a parish. She did the wedding of brother of Eric.</p>

<p>Taking a break. Walking down the back staircase. Asking myself if I could do a Buddhist exercise ala Koko Crater. Outside the sun shone. Students wandered. The temperature was moderate. It was a wonderful scene.</p>
<p>And I thought that one of the <span id="feelings"></span><strong>feelings</strong> I felt about Mom's death was <span id="relief"></span><strong>relief</strong>. And I wondered what a strange thing. Back into the &quot;aughts&quot; I had a practice of calling her every day or at least frequently. There was a sense of duty. A sense of feeling connected. But I think there have always been such an admixture of conflicted feelings. Not always the same ones. Does her dying simplify that?</p>
