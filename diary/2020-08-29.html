<p>#grief He recommends the “Welcoming prayer”, which, of course, I am familiar with through centering prayer.</p>
<p>I realized I could pray that for the anger and grief I feel with regard to Sean’s intrusion into my/our life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After you can identify the hurt and feel it in your body, welcome it. Stop fighting it. Stop splitting and blaming. Welcome the grief. Welcome the anger. It’s hard to do, but for some reason, when we name it, feel it, and welcome it, transformation can begin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>… When you’re able to welcome your own pain, you will, in some way, feel the pain of the whole world. This is what it means to be human—and, also, what it means to be divine.</p>
