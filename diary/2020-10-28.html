<h1 id="this-is-us">This is us</h1>
<p>We watched the two hour season-opening special. It was so clearly presented as a microcosm of the country. The pandemic was present at the beginning. Black Lives Matter hammered Randall and threatens the family. Kevin is pregnant with twins and seems to be on the cusp of finding a serendipitous partner. Mom has an episode. Toby is able to give Miguel wise remarks that are essentially, “Live day by day.” We saw more pieces of Randall’s birth. The drug addiction. William’s powerful grace and spiritual presence as he sought to give a family to his son.</p>
<p>It felt like Mary Pat and I were emotionally in sync as we watched. I thought how pitiful it was that Sean wanted no party to sharing it with us. Everything has to be on his terms. He has no motivation to try to know what makes us “tick”. I was tempted to say something to MP. I didn’t.</p>
<p>My dreaming seemed consistent with those thoughts and emotions. I was glad to be with the TV family, with all their conflict and varied “issues”. I slept pretty well. There seems great distance between us however.</p>
<h1 id="trigger">Trigger</h1>
<p>I feel like I am a guest in MP and Sean’s house. Sean’s schedule and limitations drive the household.</p>
<p>I feel like Mary Pat changed once Sean got here.</p>
