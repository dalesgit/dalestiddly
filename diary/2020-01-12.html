<p>Today felt really good. Even in the midst of the baptism liturgy I knew that the congregation was powerfully with me. Fr. Mark said that it was the best baptismal sermon he's ever heard.</p>
<p>My goals included:</p>
<ul>
<li>get the congregation to identify with how God's amazing grace has worked with them</li>
<li>recognize that baptism is about the community involved in the thing that we would do with Jameson Alexander Honeycutt.</li>
<li>abundance of water, signifying abundance of God's grace.</li>
<li>&quot;living into our baptism&quot;, baptism is a journey, a pilgrimage.</li>
<li>There was to be sure a <span id="fire"></span><strong>fire</strong> today</li>
</ul>
