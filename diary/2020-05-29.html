<ul>
<li>Monroe recording of Pentecost Eucharist. Ended up using the video that I had made of my sermon on iphone. AirDrop seemed to work perfectly.</li>
<li>Some thoughts about Trinity sermon. e.g. Orthodoxy has been used to divide. But Jesus wanted unity. He didn't ask, &quot;What do you believe?&quot; he said, e.g., &quot;Love the Lord your God … Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;</li>
<li>I submitted the Module 4 build it. All that seems to be left is syllabus and directions -- although it's possibly kind of far-reaching.</li>
<li>Began reviewing Module 5 materials.</li>
