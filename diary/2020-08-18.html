<p>An amazing story of the resurrection of research on psychedelic drugs in 2000, ended in 1960’s by Richard Nixon. Focus has been on psilocybin and the results reported were breath-taking. Chemistry inspiring life-changing changes in people. Rated by people portrayed as among the most important experiences of their lives.</p>
<p>Shades of what has determined my life. I know the kinds of truth that the characters spoke – e.g. “Love is the most important thing in the universe.” Earlier today I was aware that I somehow know that William Blake’s words in my “signature” are just plain true and real. How verify?</p>
