<h1 id="something-broke-me-thinks">something broke me thinks</h1>
<p>#mary-pat As I walked yesterday, the car in the shop, I wrote a draft of a response to Mary Pat. I began to get clearer about I could / should include. I got home and Sean was fixing breakfast, as it turns out, for him and Mary Pat. Shortly after, he went out to install the seat covers he had purchased for the Miata. When MP went out to praise him, I thought, “I can at least go and make my feelings of hurt known.”</p>
<p>MP took it all in as an attack on Sean, I think. When she came in she started going after me, that she was working on her depression, but implying I wasn’t dealing with mine. She said, “We’ve got a problem here.” I repeated, more slowly, more firmly, “We have a big problem here.” I told her that I had been working on what we need to talk about. But it couldn’t be with Sean around. And it didn’t seem like we were ready. She agreed.</p>
<p>I then tried to tell her how I felt about Sean and she dealing with the Miata without even informing me, to say nothing of involving me. I told her I felt like I was a cockroach on the ground. She responded:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“I’m sorry you feel that way.”</li>
<li>then she began a detailed defense and explanation for her actions</li>
</ol>
<p>I told her that neither of those was helpful.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’m awake, now (Wed Oct 14, 2020 06:19 AM), because I was spinning over and over in my head the details I’ve tried to lay out here. <strong>I had about 6 hours of sleep. For 3 days now I’ve kept track of my calories.</strong> It was easy for me to decline, except for a small bit, the meal Sean had cooked and prepared at her directions without informing me. It’s not the food I need to be eating.</p>
<p>“You say you love me. But your love hurts and marginalizes me.”</p>
<p>The word I was trying to think of days ago, I could only think of “catalyst”, was <strong>precipitate</strong> (with a short “a”). Sean is the precipitate for all the conflict and hurt going on in the household.</p>
<p>FEAR. I think that what MP did in her response yesterday was to inform me that if I tell her that something hurts me, her response will be, “I don’t care.” It feels like an unsafe place to be. I dare not run, however, because it would leave too much to MP.</p>
<p>It seems over, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>#relg101</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helpful</strong> :: reading, discussion threads &amp; responses; written form of presentations; quizzes;</li>
<li><strong>Making it difficult</strong> :: online!!; group members not being responsive; presentations not detailed enough; collaboration</li>
<li><strong>changes?</strong> :: clearer assignments; less group work; good self-reflective suggestions re. organization, asking questions</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="notes-on-zoom-meeting-1014">Notes on Zoom meeting 10/14</h1>
<p>Selena re. group discussion. Group Zoom to openly discuss. <strong>Weekly group zooms instead of general zoom each week</strong> as a suggestion.</p>
<p>Emily has appreciated the creative thought involved in my exam format. she went to a school like Iolani where creativity was emphasized.</p>
<p>Selena had clearly done the work for the exam but was rushed or frustrated in getting the format just right. I said I would accept the material via email.</p>
<p>Trista is juggling many classes and wondered if there was a problem with due dates etc.</p>
<p>I talked about 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> level discourse (theology) with Hilda – using “I love you – then Shakespeare” as egs.</p>
<p>Toward end I talked about the generational passing on of religion – in the context of Selena talking re. challenges of her 3 children being in school online.</p>
<p>That led to observing that Christianity is prone to divisions. But the characteristics of other religions is different. Selena shared experiences with Elevation Church – focusing on doing away with the “politics” of church membership etc. “It has been described as ‘a pop culture-friendly church with an orthodox Christian message.’”</p>
<h1 id="final-ending-not-well">Final ending not well</h1>
<p>MP was counting on me asking to get anti-depressant at the appointment tomorrow at Tryon. Her pleasantries of the last 24 hours have been based on that! How disgusting.</p>
<p>I have felt utterly rejected by her reaction to my pleading.</p>
<p>Then in a misunderstanding, with Sean in the living room, she claimed to want to clarify things. I said, “We’re not having this conversation now.”</p>
<h1 id="postscript-1046-pm">Postscript 10:46 pm</h1>
<p>Neither of us sleeping.</p>
<ul>
<li>“You are a fucking liar.”</li>
<li>“Just like Doug”</li>
<li>Co-dependency</li>
</ul>
<p>The elephant in the room is “codependency” – it’s not Sean. If Sean weren’t here it wouldn’t have precipitated a showdown, but the co-dependency would still be here.</p>
<p>When I told you how I felt with the Miata issue, I didn’t expect you to fix it. You offered minimizing and telling me why you were right and I was wrong. I would have like empathy.</p>
<p>You threaten to move out with Sean. It’s a replay of the 1990’s. You’re so convinced I’m the problem. Heart? Circulation? Depression? I’m not the person you loved before. But Sean is not at that place of the 1990’s. Don’t try to duplicate it. Don’t do it.</p>
<p><a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/symptoms-of-codependency/">just the first google</a> The list of characteristics feels like what we’re living in. I’m subject to it too. Maybe that’s why it has blown up. But I have had some sense of what needs (needed) to happen: boundaries, caretaking, reactivity, control, dysfunctional communication, denial, – shame, low self-esteem – I remember those.</p>
