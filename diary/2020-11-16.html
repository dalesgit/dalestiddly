<h1 id="dream-with-dates-and-moks">Dream with Date’s and Mok’s</h1>
<p>A vivid dream where we were working on the ceiling of a large cabin-like structure. It had a very high “V”. There was something needing correcting and the solution was to screw in sheets of plywood.</p>
<p>But the larger context was so very much St. Mary’s. At one point I had encountered a man who introduced himself as Bill Mok’s brother. I had never met him. Later another person, someone like one of the Ushijima’s?, asked about Bill Mok something or other and I told about having met his brother. Chris Date was there as well as his sister. Chris ended up taking the lead in fixing the roof. I was glad when I checked in to see that he had rigged an elaborate system of ropes that protected the crew from falls. It was at least 75 ft up.</p>
<p>All of it left over from the photos I saw from Emma and Lydia.</p>
<h1 id="connections-with-john-lennon">Connections with John Lennon</h1>
<p>Reading an article from Washington Post on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the album “Double Fantasy” and later this year the 40th anniversary of Lennon’s murder, I am startled by the connections I still feel after all these years.</p>
<p>I remember the fall at Nashotah House and my desire to get a copy of the album. I listened, fascinated, captivated. Later I would resonate so deeply with “Beautiful Boy”. That fall I think I resonated with “Starting over” and “Watching the wheels”.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the year I had participated in the naming of our 2nd child, Julian. It was John’s first son.</p>
<p>It was a chaotic year. I thought perhaps it was the end. But I was determined to survive. “Starting over” seemed like the best way to do that at the time.</p>
<p>The leaves were turning, then falling. Leaves everywhere and crisp air.</p>
<p>Then on Dec. 8, with winter clearly in the air, we first heard in the chapel I think. A quick whispered, not quite acceptable for “chapel” space, “He’s dead.”</p>
<p>His birthday was not quite mine: Oct. 9, 1940. What kind of presumptuousness did I possess that I would identify with John Lennon?</p>
<p>The album was released on Nov. 17, 1980.</p>
<h1 id="rensselaer">Rensselaer</h1>
<p>Something caused me to be thinking about my time at Rensselaer. Similar to my time in Hawai’i though much shorter. Pictures on the web site caused more memories although it was 30 years ago.</p>
<p>I feel so sad about the closing of St. Joseph’s College. Leaving 1,100 students bereft.</p>
