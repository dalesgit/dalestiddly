<p>Why do you stay with me? she asked, expressing the notion that she has <span id="never"></span><strong>never</strong> been good for me.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>because you have the eloquence and self-awareness to write the letter to your family</li>
<li>because you express you love through cooking -- thinking of the amount of work that went into Thanksgiving Day.</li>
<li>I thought about the standing on one leg she did, like me, as a youth -- but I wanted current things</li>
<li>her commitment to trying to live her life in accordance with her faith, even in the midst of continually falling short</li>
<li>her ability with numbers and finance</li>
<li>her deep commitment to support the little guy, the underdog, the disadvantaged</li>
</ol>
<p>In dreaming and dozing I was aware of the double-binds she gives me. She seems to not listen well -- or her mind jumps too fast to her response or the thing to []{#fix it.}<strong>fix it.</strong> She doesn't accept my judgments, treating them perhaps as pronouncements and then ignoring them. The most prominent example is that I have repeatedly asked that there be a system of &quot;allowance&quot; so we each had money that is just ours to spend or save as we see fit. She ignores it because that's basically what she has with all the money.</p>
<p>It seemed important to me to point to the ways that we experience the world differently and that it leads to lots of our disagreements. I gave the example of calendars:</p>
<ul>
<li>she thinks of calendars as written in stone</li>
<li>she puts to do items on the calendar</li>
<li>I think of calendars as &quot;targets&quot;, or &quot;possibilities&quot; that can easily be changed</li>
<li>there is, of course, the need for space versus the need for someone to talk to</li>
</ul>
<p>But the important part was that she didn't seem to hear me, or it didn't register, or she didn't see any significance to it, or she had such a need to tell me what she was thinking and feeling. I guess I give off a sense of not hearing her. So often I get the sense that she thinks I'm a very shallow person, judging by the way she responds to me.</p>
<p>All of these are insignificant in the larger scheme of things. I told her that I wasn't going to leave her -- except for death. She didn't want to go there with me, perhaps because <span id="death"></span><strong>death</strong> is all over her consciousness right now.</p>
<hr />
<p>Later in the morning, on her way out the door, I asked what was going on in her head. Her answers made me feel like, again or still, it's all my fault and my problem to solve. I showed her the text from Jim Croom that seems to say that his surgery schedule will be 1 week later than he had hoped in his last communication. I've tried to stay current with MP with what I know. Clearly her expectations are dramatically different from mine.</p>
<p>She says:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>She still doesn't know if there is going to be any time for her to go Dayton.</li>
<li>She still doesn't know if I will talk to her sisters when I get to Dayton. There is an echo of the fact that when she put me on speaker on Thanksgiving Day, that I had nothing to say to her gaily talking sisters, speaking as if nothing was wrong.</li>
</ol>
