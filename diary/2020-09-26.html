<h1 id="waking-early">Waking early</h1>
<p>The mind has been racing to put words together to form sentences. Sean this. Because of Sean that. I think of Scott and his weird hours for sleeping. And I think, “So, it has begun.” My dotage.</p>
<p>MP had asked me what I expected. It allowed me to say that I had expected him to get a bicycle and with the bus system to explore and have access to all of Rock Hill. Instead he has stayed holed up in this house, utterly dependent on his mother for transportation.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly she has step by step allowed him to become her solar system. I saw early how Sean’s appetites were ravenous for things he liked or craved. Sugar. Carbohydrates. Meat. I would say that it’s just fine with him to have his mother be his sun and moon while he gets his parole behind him. “Normal life?” What would that be for him.</p>
<p>But my point the other day was that there is no end in sight for Sean’s presence. And for me it feels ugly and it leaves me out in the cold. I guess, now, writing it down, that I might well be advised to really begin to put into place my universe. I had so thoroughly moved in to live in a universe of 2 some 9 years ago. I let go of much. I shall need to reclaim that. She can have her universe around her son, but I ought not to lose myself as compensation.</p>
<p>That is, I think, where the session with Linda was headed. Perhaps the therapeutic perspective goes there as well.</p>
<p>Some suggestive issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>cut with the tv. Last night I reflected to MP about the “first tvs” in my life. I think we must not have had a tv until we moved to Dudley. I remember walking up the street to watch Walt Disney. Was that the May’s? Were they family? I don’t know what to make of that huge and tiny box of a tv that we had watched <em>Gunga Din</em> on. Shirley would remember if I really needed to know. MP doesn’t remember a time when they didn’t have tv, and does remember the time, early, when they got color tv.</p>
<p>My later family got its first tv when Owen was 8. His family had just been blown apart and I was cynical and snotty to observe that Mo was ready to let them watch tv when I was no longer available to partner in parenting. The first tv was a small black and white console to pair with the Commodore 64 that I bought with the money from Dad’s death. 1965.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="it-just-seems-weird">It just seems weird</h1>
<p>You are planning to go to the grocery store. Your actions and words make it plain that that is an activity that you and Sean do now. For 9 years it was something you and I did together. No longer.</p>
<p>So I accept it and plan on shopping for myself I guess. Or try to piece myself into her puzzle. She wants me to be a 3rd wheel. I don’t want that.</p>
