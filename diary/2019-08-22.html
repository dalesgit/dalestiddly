<p>I awoke with a start to realize that I had been dreaming intensely about parish priest kinds of things. I was in the office of the new rector of St.Â Mary's. I had been involved with conversations about some technical things related to the computer network and internet connection there. Talking with Leland? or just referring to Leland and then referring to Chris.</p>
<p>It was strange that the school had been kicked out and the church expanded to all the space. The rector seemed a nice guy but unaware of the history. Sort of clueless.</p>
<p>It was perhaps related to a brief exchange in the car driving to Dayton. I made mention of the fact that I had been with meetings at the very beginning of organizing Family Promise in Hawai'i. Mary Pat seemed surprised. It took me back to memories of when I was a respectable and admired rector in east Honolulu. One of the &quot;senior&quot; rectors.</p>
<p>It was all a little bit similar to the feelings I had talking with Gordon and Janey -- but mostly with Janey. I make a good kind of senior, silent, partner in ministry with her. Or perhaps it's just that the memories carry me back to earlier days.</p>
<p>Talking about my interest in Nicolas Tesla at such a young age. Making the model of Edison's bulb. I immediately then identified with Tesla. And I realized that my identification with the counter-cultural type goes back a long ways. It surprised me.</p>
<p>Last night as I was in the bathroom, MP came up to ask about whether I wanted to watch a movie. She observed that her mother had changed into jammies in the living room. When they asked her, &quot;What if Dale came in?&quot; she answered that she didn't care and I wouldn't care. I felt so honored.</p>
