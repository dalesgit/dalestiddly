<h1 id="doom">Doom</h1>
<p>MP went to bed without speaking or kissing as I lay next to her. She had placated Sean but didn’t talk to me. The morning is pretty similar.</p>
<p>I have such a deep sense of foreboding, just as I have felt in times past when the life I knew was coming to an end. I feel great mourning for the life that MP and I had. I sense that life with Sean has no end in sight. There’s 3 adults in this household now. I don’t like it. I can’t shake that. Could I grow to like it?</p>
<p>I have no right nor desire to take away from MP’s deep instinctual commitment to her son. In these last hours I thought back to my brief living with George &amp; Helen in Conway in an effort to complete my studying for comprehensives. It had a timeline but I couldn’t keep it. I had to escape. What was it? Mom’s badgering me like she did when I visited in Las Cruces? It seems she didn’t cater to me at all the way MP does Sean, but I don’t trust my memory very well.</p>
<p>It was a time I remember working at George’s liquor store. Mostly positive memories there. I remember playing golf and my miracle shot on the sharp right uphill dog-leg. I remember mom caring for “big George”. It left me marveling at my mother’s care-giving ability. That’s a co-dependency kind of thing I guess. Maybe the problem was that Mom didn’t have enough energy for me? I was selfish?</p>
<p>I just don’t know if I can do this with Sean. I don’t want to leave MP. But I’m not good for her or me. I imagined moving to be near Miriam. If I could make it work I would like that I think. But my life would be torn asunder. I was scared that I was even thinking the thought. That’s significant I think.</p>
<p>It could be I’m too weak, selfish, narrow-minded and so I fail at the basic human assignments. I think also, however, that most people would be sympathetic to my circumstances: suddenly 3 adults, “recovering” addict, in a small house, during a pandemic where things are tight …</p>
<h1 id="self-awareness">Self awareness?</h1>
<p>To myself, going back a number of years, I think of myself in part as:</p>
<ul>
<li>very flexible and open to a variety of situations, until</li>
<li>I’m not, at which point I am more stubborn than a mule</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder, though, what that looks like to other people. It was long ago with Betty Ann, a personality something or other, that I came to appreciate how different those two things can be; viz. how I perceive myself and how others perceive me.</p>
<p>Does it make me look duplicitous? Lying to myself? Not to be trusted?</p>
