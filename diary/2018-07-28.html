<ul>
<li>in chromebook3 I updated the repository by moving to the relevant folder in &quot;ranger&quot;, going to terminal, then running &quot;git pull [the url of the repository]&quot;</li>
<li>I refined the search in the rsync I'm doing to the SD Card. Still it seems to keep copying files that should have been caught</li>
<li>in chromebook1 I have gitk available to look at repositories. It allows to run &quot;git gui&quot;.</li>
<li>I couldn't figure out a way to &quot;pull&quot; data using &quot;git gui&quot;</li>
<li>I worked at getting zotero working. Firefox is working in chromebook2 to allow the connector to work</li>
<li>in chromebook2 I got standalone working. 2 plugins or addons are working to enhance.
<ul>
<li>report enhancement I think isn't installed yet, but in the standalone one can run reports on items or collections. I have run a report for RELG 101 collection. It will be handy for planning purposes.</li>
<li>bibtex enhancement provides access to the bibtex citation code. It can be changed with &quot;bibtex:[new code]&quot; in the &quot;extra&quot; item</li>
</ul></li>
