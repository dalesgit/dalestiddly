<p>I feel so alone. Sean has bought his car. And I feel like I’ve cut myself off. But like the actors on “Prom” I feel all alone. Mary Pat and Sean have their world and I’m not part of it.</p>
<p>I feel like this is now Mary Pat and Sean’s household. I’m not a part of it.</p>
<p>More than that, this evening, I felt like I wasn’t myself. Partly that I didn’t know myself. But that I had lost myself. Mary Pat was the boss, making all the decisions, and the Sean episode has demonstrated that I take third fiddle. Where am I?</p>
<p>Along the way I got lost. It seems like a familiar story. Usually found in younger folks. But here I am, floundering.</p>
