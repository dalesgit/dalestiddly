<p>Today I wrote a sermon. I returned to Gingko App and I found it rewarding it. It kept me writing and the brain making connections. It needs correcting, but I can tape tomorrow.</p>
<p>I did a bunch of further work on cleaning the house. I have 10-12 boxes ready to go to storage, each with a page indexing the contents.</p>
<p>MP and I had a disagreement over the order that I made to try to get the processor piece replaced that she had broken. I felt all along that she needed to be the one making the order. I consistently experience my own perspective as not worthwhile, or she asserting her need to be in charge.</p>
<p>Barb Belle accused MP of being afraid and of quarantining. Neither of which is really true. BB is such a jerk and offense.</p>
<p>We got the word, passing the first investigation, that Sean could be here in a matter of weeks. He happened to call and his mother got to tell him.</p>
