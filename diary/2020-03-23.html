<p>“Lo, I am about to create new heavens and a new earth,” God says. A new earth sounds wonderful right now, doesn’t it? A more peaceful earth, a cleaner earth, a place of peace and of healing.</p>
<p>I recently read The Mission Walker, an astonishing travel diary written by Edie Littlefield Sundby. She walked the entire historic 1600-mile El Camino Real de las Californias, the old mission trail from Loreto, Mexico, to Sonoma, California. She did it with one lung, after surviving widespread metastasis of stage IV gall bladder cancer and 79 rounds of aggressive chemotherapy. She’d been given three months to live.</p>
<p>What is the point of it all, one might ask, a dying woman forcing herself through often desolate and harsh landscapes in order to reach another mission, some of them decrepit and long abandoned? We might see Sundby’s journey as an excruciating exercise in nostalgia. Yet unseen is what God is doing in her tormented body. As she pushes herself on to every single mission site (some still in use, most in ruins), she is being healed. She lives today, twelve years after her diagnosis and six years after setting out on her hero’s journey.</p>
<p>Of this stunning pilgrimage, Sundby says: “If I was walking, I was alive.”</p>
<p>Might that be what the Spirit is saying to us as Church, the People of God? Even the Notre Dame Cathedral is under construction again. We all are. God is doing something new. Keep walking, Church. It just might be that God is healing us too.</p>

<p>This is a startling story of resurrection and healing. What resonates with me is the part about &quot;keep walking&quot; -- it's not about the destination it's about the journey. Don't worry about being perfect, just move. I saw that with my mother and her walking. Her reason for living was reduced to feeding pigeons. But she kept feeding pigeons.</p>
