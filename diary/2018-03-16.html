<h1 id="Friday">Friday</h1>
<p>I wonder what this would be like? So from an arbitrary file I can quickly jump to today's wiki by highlighting the calendar date. I do kind of like that.</p>
<p>Today Bill called to tell me / us about our &quot;other&quot; sister. Paul &amp; Shirley got in touch with him. They had been trying to reach David but couldn't reach him. He was driving to Bill's house and out of reach. So they told Bill.</p>
<p>There was a woman had been trying to contact her birth parents for many years. Seemingly as far back as 1968 she had contacted our Dad -- for Bill &quot;the good doctor.&quot; An attorney for Dad contacted her saying that he wanted nothing to do with her and she was never to contact him again.</p>
<p>Evidently through DNA they have determined that the woman does share a bloodline with us, but only 1 parent. Dad is not her father.</p>
<p>She has said that she would like to see her mother before she dies.</p>
<p>Bill has said no he doesn't think that's a good idea.</p>
<p>Mary Pat keeps asking me how I feel? Am I ok? And I think it just doesn't phase me very much. I would welcome meeting her and getting to know a family member.</p>
