<p>I haven’t done well with journaling or with food journaling. I feel like life has run away and I’m floundering like a diseased marine mammal.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning as we went on a fruitless quest for Sean’s car I still felt like I had been manipulated and bitter, with overtones of Emma’s response to me. Emma makes me feel, “Fuck it.”</p>
<p>The hour drive in the back seat was actually pretty peaceful and I got to look at the scenery – something I really have an opportunity to do. The houses revealed such a range of social standing: abandoned shacks, rusted out trailers for sale, old established farm buildings, million dollar spreads tucked away behind a bank of pines, upscale neighborhoods erected on what would have been agricultural lands.</p>
<p>The internet has come and gone over the last 12 hours. Where are my prompts?</p>
