<h1 id="Dream">Dream</h1>
<p>Long extended through several awakenings, dream that may have been built off of the impressionistic movie <em>Youth</em> that we watched last night.</p>
<ul>
<li>setting was more like Colorado (my youth) than it was Hawaii. Most of my dreams of the past years have been set in Hawai'i. The Mountain and the large body of water were somehow Hawaii.</li>
<li>today there was the theme of not being able to get where I needed to be. Bicycles had figured in getting into the mountains. I had traveled with a larger group of people.</li>
<li>but I needed to get back as time was running out. Back to what? I'm not sure. Home?</li>
</ul>
<p>Last night's movie featured themes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>slowly forgetting the details of youth</li>
<li>memories that were too painful to stay in touch with (a wife that he had let down and who for many years was catatonic in a home in Venice.)</li>
<li>finally being able to conduct his most well-known (not best) musical composition, <em>Simple Songs</em>. The Queen requested it but he had long resisted because of his scarred memories related to his wife.</li>
</ul>
<p>It really hurt me to know that Miriam has posted about &quot;Grandma Bridget.&quot;</p>
