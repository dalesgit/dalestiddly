<ol type="1">
<li>a very vivid scene, definitely color. setting a camp or school kind of setting. There were uniforms and officers or teachers. One of them has &quot;gone rogue&quot; and was torturing a student in the most gruesome way. He was almost gleefully cutting off his fingers with a large tool. I had read just before sleeping about the recording of Kashoggi's murder in Turkey. The infraction of the student had been to be slightly &quot;counter-cultural.&quot;</li>
<li>Again a setting that was a kind of school. It was a blending of Angels at Play, Iolani, Chaminade. I was in it. Doing what? I think I was trying to teach, like I'm going to try to do again at WU.</li>
