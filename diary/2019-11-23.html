<h1 id="Shakespeare:">Shakespeare:</h1>
<p>quoted in novel and evoked in movie with Proust scholar</p>
<p>William Shakespeare – &quot;Remembrance of things past&quot; – Sonnet 30 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past, I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste. Then can I drown an eye, unus’d to flow, For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night, And weep afresh love’s long since cancell’d woe, And moan th’ expense of many a vanish’d sight. Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan, Which I new pay as if not paid before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All losses are restor’d, and sorrows end.</p>
