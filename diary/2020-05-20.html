<p>I try to move it forward a little each day. I'm now on day 6. I wish I was further along. But in reviewing today for Module 4 I began to realize that the goal of the end of the course is to have the basics of a course. Then, I guess the 2nd course will refine that.</p>
<p>I have taught Â½ of this online, but a number of the pieces were already there. I think I can do this. I think I have months to finish, but I am motivated to get it over with.</p>
<p>The story is that I can't start the next course until I've finished this one. I think by next week some time I should be done. In the meantime, I have to get through tomorrow's filming of Sunday's mass and the ultra-sound on my heart and liver.</p>
<p>I wonder what can realistically be expected from these tests? I feel apprehensive about a long day tomorrow. Preaching from a mask again.</p>
<p>And the problematic task of doing church in a recording, behind a mask. At least the Zoom process at Our Saviour doesn't require the mask. Maybe I need to talk about that with Charlotte?</p>
