<p>I slept well. Over 8 hours I think. The only change was that I took an Ibuprofen for the pain in my arthritis joints.</p>
<p>I had told Sean at dinner, after he said to me, “Thank you for making me a dinner that I liked (I had to make to dinners to cater to his tastes).” I responded by saying, (I think I said you’re welcome first, but I went on to say), “This is the first household I’ve ever been in when such a thing would be tolerated. I have no tolerance for that sort of thing.”</p>
<p>I don’t know if that was perhaps terrible and awful on my part. Apparently he’s working on his “4th step”. I may have thrown back in his face disapproval, rejection, … I don’t know?</p>
