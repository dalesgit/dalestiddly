<p>After talking with Bill yesterday I tried to process my feelings and eventually said to MP that I was a little bit afraid of spending a whole week with Bill &amp; Karla. She, of course, wanted to reassure me. But I was just trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>I still don't understand it. It is that we've never stayed in the same place for that long before. That we are a bunch of old people stuck in their ways. And it occurred to me that part of it is that it may well be the last time for us. And Bill, for all practical purposes, is my family. MP has some backups.</p>
