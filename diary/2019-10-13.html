<p>Early in the night I had a vivid dream. I woke from it to pee; then MP woke up and I was able to repeat the dream to her. The setting was a place very like the bedroom we were sleeping in, here at Liki Tiki. There was a sense of someone's presence. I looked around. I moved toward the bathroom and there was someone there, someone being coy I thought. It was Julian. Then I opened the door and there was Emma, enjoying a bath, with bubbles and having a gay old time.</p>
<p>I was upset that she snuck into the house rather than saying something to me. I told her that she would have to leave, but she was always welcome to be in my home if she could talk to me. I felt conflicted.</p>

<p>Apparently in a recent article Jim Wallis proclaims that Donald Trump's policy are <span id="anti-Christian"></span><strong>anti-Christian</strong> -- thus any follower of Trump has abandoned his/her Christian faith. It is a form of an answer to the basic question I asked. (Chicago Sun-Times, Oct. 10, Neil Steinberg)</p>

<p>Note from her yesterday that she has been &quot;rejected&quot; ... the &quot;great Oz has spoken.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps a <span id="reason"></span><strong>reason</strong> for my sponsoring Sue's petition to be a postulant was so that her failed effort was not associated with one of the active clergy -- esp. Janey Wilson. Or perhaps I could say that it was a <span id="function"></span><strong>function</strong> that I could serve in the diocese. The diocesan structures can just think of me when they go &quot;Can you believe ...&quot; &quot;The Great Oz&quot; is a pretty good way to refer to that authority structure.</p>
