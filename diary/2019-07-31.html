<h1 id="Dream">Dream</h1>
<p>Shirley and I were interacting at a family reunion. I don't know what family, because there were lots of people there. Tens if not a hundred or so. It was in Colorado, I imagine, because there were mountains and pine forests. Shirley was somehow humbled and therefore approachable. Or perhaps I had forgiven her for the great destruction she had caused. We weren't friends but we talked. It all seemed important in the dream, but now I can't remember very much.</p>
<p>We watched episodes from <em>New Amsterdam</em> last night. We are both caught up in and care about the characters. MP and I both agree that one of the female actors is beautiful. I pointed it out because most of the time I don't have a sense of beauty other than inner beauty shining out. :w</p>
