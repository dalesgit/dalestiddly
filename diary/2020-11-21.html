<ul>
<li>Just processing the failure with Emma and wondering what comes next</li>
<li>We had a blow like no other when Sean sat down and asked, “Do you have a few minutes?”</li>
<li>I ended up saying that yes, I wanted him gone</li>
<li>I thought he acted like a spoiled 16 y/o</li>
<li>I told him that he may have caused the failure of our marriage</li>
<li>MP was mightily hurt, finally announcing that she was leaving. “I’m so tired, I can’t do this anymore.” I stayed calm, persuading her to talk. I tried to find ways to move past the blame-game. I focused on: you believe “A”; I believe “B”; how can we find “C”</li>
<li>I suggested one model of “C” would be involving Sean in the conversation.</li>
<li>We settled on:
<ol type="1">
<li>he can get a car</li>
<li>following he will be charged for room and board</li>
<li>I tried to be explicit that I thought the car was mis-guided. That the challenge of living independently was huge and that dealing with a car was a distraction from that goal.</li>
<li>I included reference to my rejection of paying for his canned drinks</li>
<li>But I agreed to the deal. He was happy with it.</li>
<li>I think surprising MP that he would feel better at paying room/board</li>
</ol></li>
