<h1 id="Heart">Heart</h1>
<p>After just a little over 1Â½ hours sleep I awoke and couldn't go back to sleep. I came out into the kitchen and something convinced me to take my ECG. It reported normal, though there seemed variations in the pattern. I started out with a very high BPM, later reporting from my watch that it spiked at 97 BPM. It gradually went down.</p>
<p>Hydrating?</p>
