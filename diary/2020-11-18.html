<p>I was with I think Mary Pat. A partner. We were scavenging for electronic parts because we were trying to “save” something. From being attacked? From falling apart? It was an urban environment and I obviously knew some technical things that were going to be helpful. It was a little bit bleak. A little like post-catastrophe but not not post-apocalypse. There were bad guys out there. But it was an up-beat and hopeful attitude around us.</p>
<p>The last thing I remember was that we had scavenged 2 parts of old pieces that were going to be helpful, though not everything we needed. I looked more closely at one and realized it was part of a printer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yesterday before going to sleep I was a little bit successful at keeping a plane in the sky in Google Earth flight simulator. It was exhilarating for me. I thought a little bit like the electronic games that keep Mary Pat occupied I think for hours in a day. Sean plays other kind of games, a networked adventure kind?</p>
<p>I’ve not made a practice of that kind of diversion very much in my life. But the flight simulator I’ve wanted to dabble in from time to time. The last serious attempt was still on the C-64 and the origin of the “game” was Meigs field in Chicago. That’s been gone for a long time.</p>
<p>But even then there was a sense of being liberated, of traveling to new sights and places. But last night there was even more a sense of nostalgia. My last flight was around Colorado Springs and the front range. I was able to fly pretty steady. It seemed like it was level as I flew over Colorado Springs headed for Pikes Peak. But I flew into the ground in a neighborhood. Even as it was happening I thought, “The altimeter is ‘above sea-level’ and where I’m flying is getting higher and higher pretty quickly.” Not the crash but seeing the pretty vivid scenery was like being free and seeing familiar places.</p>
<p>I crashed in a neighborhood maybe not far from where Mo and Julian live.</p>
<h1 id="zoom-session-101">Zoom session 101</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hilda &amp; Trista</li>
<li>Hilda asking about Heaven and Hell in Judaism</li>
<li>Trista cried at <em>Sunflower</em></li>
<li>Trista enjoyed the class more than others, time of wrestling with issues, not just 101 sort of classes. It was what she wanted from a “college” sort of experience</li>
<li><strong>We decided to have Zoom next week. Trista clearly values the conversation and has missed several sessions for whatever reason</strong>.</li>
<li>Hilda confused by the opening of Abrahamic text. I told her stories of my encounter with Islam and learning Hebrew, the alphabet being so much what I didn’t know. Needing to educate about Islam after 9/11 my sense is that most Christians don’t know very much about the 3 religions. Even Judaism which good church-goers think they know is in so many ways a foreign sort of thing.</li>
<li>So, told Hilda that being disoriented and not knowing what to do with all the strange words and concepts is in fact the beginning of knowledge.</li>
