<h1 id="the-movie-chernobyl-the-movie-chernobyl">The movie <em>Chernobyl</em> {#The movie Chernobyl}</h1>
<p>The series ends with <span id="truth"></span><strong>truth</strong> prevailing with the courage of the scientist Legasov.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Truth doesn't care about lies. It will prevail. Every time there is a lie there is a debt to truth. Even if it takes eons, truth will prevail.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span id="Legasov"></span><strong>Legasov</strong>: I've already trod on dangerous ground. We're on dangerous ground right now, because of our secrets and our lies. They're practically what define us. When the truth offends, weâ€”we lie and lie until we can no longer remember it is even there. But it is...still there. Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid. That is how...an RBMK reactor core explodes: Lies</p>
<p>[<em>April 26, 1988: Alone in his apartment in Moscow, Professor Valery Legasov replays his voice on a tape recorder</em>]</p>
<p>[]{#Valery Legasov}<strong>Valery Legasov</strong>: What is the cost of lies? It's not that we'll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all. What can we do then? What else is left to abandon even the hope of truth and content ourselves instead with stories? In these stories, it doesn't matter who the heroes are. All we want to know is: &quot;Who is to blame?&quot; In this story, it was Anatoly Dyatlov. He was the best choice. An arrogant, unpleasant man, he ran the room that night, he gave the orders... and no friends. Or at least, not important ones. And now Dyatlov will spend the next ten years in a prison labor camp. Of course, that sentence is doubly unfair. There were far greater criminals than him at work. And as for what Dyatlov did do, the man doesn't deserve prison. He deserves death.</p>
<p>[<em>Ending scene: As Legasov is driven away from Chernobyl by the KGB, his voice on tape is heard</em>]</p>
<p><span id="Legasov"></span><strong>Legasov</strong>: To be a scientist is to be naive. We are so focused on our search for truth, we fail to consider how few actually want us to find it. But it is always there, whether we see it or not, whether we choose to or not. The truth doesn't care about our needs or wants. It doesn't care about our governments, our ideologies, our religions. It will lie in wait for all time. And this, at last, is the gift of Chernobyl. Where I once would fear the cost of truth, now I only ask: &quot;What is the cost of lies?&quot;</p>
