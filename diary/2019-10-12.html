<p>There is an increasing sense that Trump is going to go. And yet, ... I wonder. I'm not confident this is going to turn out well. And then we have the possibility of President Pence -- perhaps voted in by a sympathy vote?</p>
<p>We watched the sun set last night from the beach. It was awesome. Each of us had a sense that we may have seen a &quot;green flash.&quot; It was hushed. Various groups of people just soaking in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Since I finished my Susan Howatch novel -- via the 6th in the series, <em>Absolute Truths</em> -- I'm not sure what to pick up next. The novel allowed me to turn on a little of the self-reflection that the series originally did. I remember telling Bob Fitzpatrick about the novels, and also thinking that he was almost overly dismissive. And yet I think his abuse of power, his reliance on his intellectual gifts at the expense of the grace and redemption that is required of his leadership role, all of these things were addressed in the series.</p>
<p>But perhaps the James Martin piece on the Jesuit way of life could lead me into some of the same kind of places. But it is usually novels that have the power to ignite my soul, transport my inner life.</p>
