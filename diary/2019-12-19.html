<h1 id="all-i-want-for-christmas-all-i-want-for-christmas">All I want for Christmas {#All I want for Christmas}</h1>
<p>We had an exchange yester even after we got home. &quot;What would you like for Christmas?&quot; She said a few things. I thought for a while. It was difficult. But I wanted to take the question seriously.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing I said was I wanted to be able to draw. Ever since I was little I wanted to have talent for it. But I didn't.</li>
<li>The next thing, similar, I want to be able to play piano. Of course in one sense I've been able to play my whole life. But I've wanted to be able to play it like a musician. Cf. my current struggle to transcribe <em>These Islands</em>.</li>
<li>The last thing I said, a simple acquisition kine, was another pair of jeans. Made of stuff that is sort of comfortable to wear.</li>
</ul>
<p>I included:</p>
<ul>
<li>a storm door like the Dayton house has</li>
<li>a fireplace that works</li>
<li>live by the ocean</li>
<li>to be able to talk to my daughters</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="compiling-emacs-26.3-compiling-emacs-26.3">Compiling emacs 26.3 {#Compiling emacs 26.3}</h1>
<p>I couldn't find an easy way to install 26.3. I needed the latest version instead of what was in Bionic in order to test <span id="Spacemacs"></span><strong>Spacemacs</strong> which seems like it might be a superior way to run emacs for me. It also gives me a measuring stick to compare my own configuration files for emacs.</p>
<p>various fixes for the error (running on 25.3 in Bionic) seemed like the might not be necessary on a later emacs.</p>
<p>I wanted dev files for gtk cp. <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/101306/how-do-i-install-gtk-3-0" class="uri">https://askubuntu.com/questions/101306/how-do-i-install-gtk-3-0</a></p>
<p>followed directions at <a href="http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2017/07/30/building-emacs-25-2-on-xubuntu-17-04/" class="uri">http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2017/07/30/building-emacs-25-2-on-xubuntu-17-04/</a></p>
<p>downloaded source from <a href="http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/gnu/ftp/gnu/emacs/" class="uri">http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/gnu/ftp/gnu/emacs/</a></p>
<p>I looked to include dev files for &quot;jpeg&quot; and &quot;gnutls&quot; -- tried to include &quot;xpm&quot; when neotree wasn't working</p>
