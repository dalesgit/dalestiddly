<p>Bill telling me that it had been he that tended the rhubarb and the strawberries. Not to be surprised that he is now creating a garden, knowing how to check the &quot;ph&quot; via youtube and other searches.</p>
<p>Bill tells me that he was the one who tended the rhubarb and the strawberries in our back yard. I didn't know</p>
<p>This was in a conversation about his growing a garden during this time of quarantine and stay-at-home</p>
<p>He and Karla are vulnerable and senior citizen caliber</p>

<p>Open-source is probably the biggest factor. By that I don't mean &quot;free&quot;. Goes back to the line that there's free as in beer -- and free as in speech. Open-source software is free speech. A good case can be made that the world runs on open-source software -- even though it is closed-source outfits that have monopolized and made money. But it ends up flexible. Lots of options. In some cases there is more opportunity than in closed-source. Other times one has to settle for &quot;a little more awkward.&quot; But I would say that everything you can do with closed-source you can do better in open-source. But you may have to work a little harder. An example is that I am currently taking a certification course on Blackboard so that Winthrop University will let me teach online -- even though I have been doing it since 2011. The fact is that because of the work I have done in open-source software I can make Blackboard do things that most people can't imagine. Another goes back 15 years or so. I used to use a program called Leo. It was a versatile program for managing information. There was a glitch that I couldn't solve in an export I was trying to accomplish. I emailed the programmer -- who lived in France. He responded within hours and by the end of the day had patched the program so that it worked. It was so cool being connected like that. Â· Reply</p>
