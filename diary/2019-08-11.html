<h1 id="phone-to-bill-phone-to-bill">Phone to Bill {#Phone to Bill}</h1>
<ul>
<li>House has been closed, gay couple?</li>
<li>as co-executor of will I would have ca. $17,000, while the 9 others would get ca. 15. David would get ca. $10; but like Bill and us he doesn't need it. Bill ficitiously said maybe he would give it to Emma.</li>
<li>Mary Pat felt pushed out, rejected by Bill &amp; Karla. She acknowledged she wants to stay in touch with Karla while she is still knowing people.</li>
<li>Sam, Logan, Katrina, Owen, Julian, Miriam, Lydia, Emma</li>
<li>Phoenix in Dec. is expensive lodging</li>
<li>perhaps we could drive out in Nov. or Dec. Mary Pat kicks self for not cutting short our month in Florida</li>
<li>Bill may be getting out of his boot next week</li>
<li>they have storage for all the &quot;stuff&quot; they brought back -- ca. $100 per month. They have carried storage for a long time over the years.</li>
<li>They are squabbling about how to get rid of &quot;stuff&quot; in their house, just like us here.</li>
<li>MP seems mad at me for I'm not sure what</li>
<li>She visibly puts down my kids who don't talk to us -- rejecting her</li>
<li>she is upset that Bill thinks that we need the money</li>
<li>possible uses of the money:
<ul>
<li>give to my kids</li>
<li>give to Lee who is left out?</li>
<li>distribute evenly (except David?)</li>
<li>give to the most needy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Dream">Dream</h1>
<p>Julian and someone else and I were riding bicycles. It was a long trip, but we were just at the beginning. We were meeting up with other parts of the family. Which? Who? I don't know. But we were in land similar to Colorado.</p>
<p>The interesting thing was that we witnessed before we got on our bikes an attack from a foreign government. There was an ocean and ships and they were being bombed, similar to Pearl Harbor. We tried to tell people about it, but they ignored us and went on their way. What perplexed me was the bit about no one paying attention, or caring, or believing the news. It seems like what is going on now with Trump.</p>
