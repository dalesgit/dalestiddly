<h1 id="Owen">Owen</h1>
<p>I dreamed several times in different ways about Owen. He was my first born. I preached about first born sons. Owen was the one who opened up my tears. Joy, but I guess also tears.</p>
<p>I have thought for many years that his plague was similar to mine with my father. He wasn't going to be able to sustain his haughty superiority. I have not heard from him for a long time now. No thank you as we gave him $9,000 for his children. Something's going on. Sins of the fathers?</p>
