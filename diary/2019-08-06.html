<h1 id="dreams-dreams">Dream(s) {#Dream(s)}</h1>
<p>Early in my sleep I had an old dream. I was in charge of the liturgy. It was relatively important. But I messed up everything about it. It was a complete and utter failure.</p>
<p>Prior to waking another more common and recent dream. Similar theme I guess.</p>
<p>&gt; Could it be related to accepting a late invitation to supply at the Chapel of Christ the King in Charlotte this coming Sunday?</p>
<p>I was supposed to play a part in a large graduation ceremony. There were several people with me. Perhaps Julian? (He called). Or a boy and a girl? We were shunted off somewhere to wait for a period. But then I missed the group I was supposed to be with -- handing out the diplomas or some such thing. Then I was madly racing around trying to catch up with my group or at least find out what I was supposed to do. I failed.</p>
