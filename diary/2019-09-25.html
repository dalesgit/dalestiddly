<h1 id="dear-lydia-dear-lydia">Dear Lydia, {#Dear Lydia,}</h1>
<p>I dreamed about you last night. It had to do with deep and powerful memories. I was remembering how you were the light of my life from the moment you were born.I remembered holding you as an infant, slowly swinging you in my arms and singing to you. And then it ended with thinking how proud I was to be able to hear you present your paper at the conference in Memphis. I thought to myself that what you did there was far superior to anything I ever accomplished in all of my college days. I dreamed about you last night, and in the dream I was able to tell you how much I have loved you and how much I love you to this day.</p>
