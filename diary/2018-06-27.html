<p>I feel like I'm in my element. As in preaching, there is a certain amount of nervousness, but not real apprehension the way there is even, say, with Pierson &amp; Grace.</p>
<p>Things to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>pray ahead of time</li>
<li>what would impediments be like?</li>
<li>meet Barbara at Our Savior</li>
<li>this is really an acknowledgment that I have agreed to be Spiritual Director. I []{#must, therefore, get my own spiritual director}<strong>must, therefore, get my own spiritual director</strong></li>
<li>read one of the strange bios from <em>Give us this day</em> and invite her comment</li>
<li>ask about her prayer, dreams</li>
<li>continue conversation re. vision for ministry</li>
</ul>
