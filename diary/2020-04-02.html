<ul>
<li>1 hour lectio. Better than I expected at making connections, but my expectations were []{#very, very}<strong>very, very</strong> low.</li>
<li>put a hook on Mary Pat's pants so they could be used for the first time in 6 years or so</li>
<li>broke a glass all over the kitchen floor</li>
<li>wrote the first draft of Palm Sunday sermon</li>
<li>watched <em>Life of Brian</em></li>
<li>worked a little with Voom on vim. I kind of like it.</li>
<li>the best thing I've been doing the past weeks has been my walks and the knowledge, wisdom I have gained.</li>
<li>At the <em>lectio</em> in reading Philippians I first latched onto the need to have a global view of things -- which I've been doing on my walks -- and took from that a kind of going through the lesson to the other side -- and said that I felt called to be humble and serve Mary Pat.</li>
<li>She has struggled with the desire to help others during this time but she doesn't know how. Seeing all the suffering hurts her.</li>
<li>The interview from <em>On Being</em> was with the Iranian woman who has led the movement to unionize among home workers etc.</li>
</ul>
