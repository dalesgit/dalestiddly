<p>It was never my intention to cut off contact with you. I am sorry for having hurt you. It was never my intention to do that.</p>
<p>Putting it that serves as a reminder that part of what I tried to say in our last conversation was that &quot;in spite of our intentions, often a different result occurs than what we intended.&quot; I kept repeating &quot;unintended consequences.&quot; We often end up hurting others even when it is not our intention. I speak of and for myself.</p>
<p>I have experienced a deep sense of family -- what it means to be father, daughter, brother, sister -- with Mary Pat's family. I think it may be similar to what my brother David experienced with his in-laws. Maybe Bill and Shirley also. Sadly, -- and it may well be because of mistakes that I have made -- my family has not been able to provide the same sense of family.</p>
<p>My friends have said to me things like, &quot;I can't imagine doing that ... as a (parent, brother, son).&quot; I am not totally off my rocker for expecting certain things of &quot;family.&quot; But an ordinary family is not what I have. I have a broken one. Of course one of my assumptions for many years is that most, if not all, people come from broken families. But I observe that some take <span id="alienation"></span><strong>alienation</strong> to be an expected outcome in a family. Others do not. I just have to accept that my family is what it is.</p>
<p>I have friends who have been heroic in their actions as (parent, brother, son). I wish I could be more open about that, but their story is not my story to tell.</p>
<p>In rather bitter contrast I have seen members of families in actions that are abominable, venal, dishonest, disrespectful -- I could go on. It makes a difference what we do and how we act. But I suppose that you know that; so forgive me for sounding like I am lecturing. I don't know how to respond to people who look like they are members of my family when they act like that.</p>
<p>When we talked I was feeling especially hurt at what feels like other people stealing my children from me. Anger at what other people have done to hurt my children. I have no right to expect that you would in fact be able to empathize with my pain, but I do know of your deep devotion and love for your own children. I am so grateful for that devotion. I forget that I am not just anybody off the street to you, but a father who was divorced from your mother when you were but quite young.</p>
<p>Now after the funeral of my mother I have observed members of my family acting in the most dishonest, disrespectful way, but with a smile as if they were saints at work. I don't know what to do with that.</p>
<p>Sometimes I just wish that I could be a father with a daughter the way I see others enjoying it. I actually really love being a grandfather. I forget that all of my children have issues with me and that I will never have such a relationship. It makes me sad.</p>
<p>&gt; I feel your pain&quot; is not a good response to someone who has lost a child.</p>
