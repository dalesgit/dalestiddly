<p>MP has talked to Katie and Annie ahead of our planned drive up there on or around the weekend of the 15th. The timing depends on whether St.Â Paul's is going to need me for that Sunday. The big question in Dayton is what kind of reception we will have. She has worked diligently to identify and repair -- to the extent that she can -- the damage from our previous trip.</p>
<p>She reports that the reason Frannie is opposed to any pain medication, even arguing over whether to give her an aspirin, is a theological position that has driven her into horror. It reminds me of how Donald Trump is destroying the country and the world because of their theological position. But Frannie apparently -- though we don't have it from her mouth -- believes that her mother has to suffer for all the terrible things that she has done in order to expedite her entrance into paradise.</p>
<p>MP responded, apparently to Annie as well as in her telling me the story, &quot;When did Frannie become God.&quot;</p>

<p>We watched <em>Diary of Anne Frank</em>, 1959 classic. Another catastrophe movie. We've watched 3 of them the last few days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queen &amp; AIDS</li>
<li>Chernobyl &amp; Nuclear World</li>
<li>BP &amp; the Gulf oil catastrophe</li>
<li>Pentagon Papers &amp; government secrecy to conduct war</li>
<li>Diary of Anne Frank &amp; Shoah</li>
</ul>

<p>I worked on finishing the placemats. It is a challenging project and I'm still not sure how to do it properly. I repaired some things as MP really went through her Christmas stuff for the first time in a long while. She has decorated the house, especially putting out 50+ Santas. I am grateful for her investment in these tasks, although I have been a little frustrated by the way things get shuffled off to another area of the house that I'm just supposed to deal with. As clutter is cleaned out of the living area it gets stacked somewhere else. As she has organized Christmas stuff things pile up in the office and the garage -- places I have worked so hard to de-clutter and organize. Ah.</p>
