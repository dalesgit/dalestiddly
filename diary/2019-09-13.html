<p>I was dreaming a kind of evacuation. Lots of people. Going some place. As I was dreaming I wanted to stay in the dream, as if it were a good dream. But when I awoke I realized that it left me with a feeling of doom. Or maybe foreboding. Connected with seeing the Judge's tonight? Telling Peter I'm not going to teach?</p>
<p>The most important point this morning about teaching is that adjuncts are exploited so by the institution. I think of saying to Peter, if WU treated adjuncts with a little more respect I would stay.</p>
<p>I don't know how true all of that is?</p>
