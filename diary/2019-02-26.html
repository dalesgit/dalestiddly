<h1 id="subjective-truth-subjective-truth">Subjective Truth {#Subjective Truth}</h1>
<p>Reading today from Mary history of mathematics, I read two paragraphs describing George Berkeley’s sweeping critique of the leading mathematicians of his day, Newton and Leibniz. He was focused on their separate but contemporary understanding of calculus. He made the case that they were nowhere near as absolute in their knowledge as they portrayed, but rather they fudged in all kinds of places where they claimed certainty. I thought immediately of the chapters I have read about him and his role in forging radical skepticism, in the midst of the 18th century.</p>
<p>Mary Pat invited me to read these pages in the light of my sharing with her my experience is the last 24 hours with my students, as I attempted to address the radical relativism of their thought processes. I learned from one student that in their hmxp class the teacher had advocated for alternate truths. A phrase for truth as subjectivity to use a phrase of Kierkegaard's. The best student in my morning class seemed surprised to realize that I didn't regard religion as an opinion but rather as some higher kind of epistemological knowledge.</p>
<p>In a corset today, perhaps in the shower, I determined on a response to Berkeley’s critique. it is reminiscent of Kierkegaard’s phrase:</p>
<p>&gt; we only understand backwards oh, but we have to live forwards.</p>
<p>This is of course implies that we live forward into uncertainty, into a gray world when what seems looking backwards to be black and white.</p>
<p>This leads me to this formulation:</p>
<p>&gt; we can know nothing with absolute certainty, but we know a great many things, far too many even to catalog, with approximation. The relativity that we live in is like the relativity of Chaos Theory. It is founded on the theoretical absolute certainty that we cannot know, but it reliably predicts that small shifts can have a major impact on systems. Our knowing things is a system. We cannot know the time and the place for an electron in an absolute sense, but we know approximately. (W. Heisenberg)</p>
