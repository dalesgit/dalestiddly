<p>Today we spent a bunch of time with Mary Pat's other cousin from the Gulf side of the state, Judy Baughman. There was much to like and I called her &quot;cuz&quot; at one point. She accepted and referred to me as &quot;cousin&quot; on Facebook.</p>
<p>The one thing that I appreciated about being at Disney World was []{#the people}<strong>the people</strong>. There were young and old. An abundance of people from outside the country. Handicapped people. Children. A wide range of people wearing Mickey's ears. Really I could spend the whole day just looking at people. It's a form of loving.</p>
<p>Quote from Walt Whitman about the wonder of all the influences that have come together to form the &quot;I&quot; that is speaking now.</p>
