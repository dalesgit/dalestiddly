<p>The news about Emma is really quite painful. Engenders a kind of hopelessness. What goes by the name <span id="fatalism"></span><strong>fatalism</strong>.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell Bill but didn’t get a chance about a sensation I have become aware of. It’s connected to the memories that have been spun up these past few days and weeks as I have gone through so much in my file boxes, in order to cull to make space for Sean. I have been taken back to memories of the 70’s and 80’s.</p>
<p>So long ago. But it was me. Is me. We watched <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>. And I remember how I was so powerfully moved by that movie that it seemed to control my emotional thinking for years to come. Watching, with Mary Pat’s fresh look, I wondered what was it? The recklessness? The self-aggrandizement? The fatalism? The outcast genius (cf. Tesla at a similar time in my life)?</p>
<p>I think, now I am an old man. In the twilight of my life. How did that happen? Like a young mother-to-be.</p>
<p>So I think of messages I tell myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have lost so much in my life, this one thing (whatever the portend of the moment might be) doesn’t mean so very much. This is to tell myself that I can withstand another loss, another blow.</li>
<li>I am so tired. I am overwhelmed with what is being expected of me. But then the new day begins -- or the new task, like getting ready to go to bed -- and I discover that, “I can do this.” Taking one step at a time, I will do it.</li>
</ul>
