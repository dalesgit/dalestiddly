<h1 id="bridget-emma----james-hoffa-bridget-emma-james-hoffa">Bridget &amp; Emma -- James Hoffa {#Bridget &amp; Emma â€“ James Hoffa}</h1>
<p>For months or more I have not thought more than a moment about Bridget. Then in my dream last night she was very present. Whatever I was doing she was more poisonous than she was in the marriage -- and that was a lot.</p>
<p>We watched <em>Irishman</em> the other night. The most poignant part for me was Frank Sheehan's daughter, a favorite of his but also of his friend Jimmy Hoffa. The movie related that after she saw him handle the massive news of Hoffa's disappearance, knowing that he was involved, she wouldn't speak to him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Obviously I'm somebody like Hoffa's killer to Emma.</p>
<p>The dreaming, by the way, continued into the morning and the last one, where I was having problems getting all of my things together for the international flight home -- and was thrown off the intermediary's shipment. He was too frustrated with me and with another situation. I wasn't going home that day. That kind of &quot;final solution&quot; hasn't often happened.</p>
