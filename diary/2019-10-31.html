<p>Took MP to the airport and it led to numerous delays stacked on top of one another. She finally arrived home but was clearly discouraged and said she would tell me tomorrow (today).</p>
<p>For Julian and me it was mostly restaurants: Redfrog &amp; McToads when back from the airport and &quot;The Reef&quot; at night. It had been the restaurant MP had intended to go to. I dressed up a little and we ate on the lanai, listening to the sound of lapping ocean. Julian's scallops were perhaps the best ever.</p>
<p>The real event it seems was planning for the next day. We're going to rent bikes for all day, ride them on the beach, and eat a lunch out next to the ocean.</p>
