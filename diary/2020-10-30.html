<h1 id="they-finally-vandalized-our-sign">They finally vandalized our sign</h1>
<p>Yesterday in the afternoon I noticed that our “Our America …” had been cut up. My first thought was that it had been up for far longer than I thought it would been. The tensions are growing as election day draws near. Violence is in the air. I felt violated, attacked, assaulted.</p>
<p>But I didn’t know how to respond. Turn the other cheek? Give up? Roll over? Sarcasm? I thought about making a sign like a bandage of the remaining pieces, like a “sold” sign with the word “Really?”. As if to say, “Is this really your America.”</p>

<p>She’s someone to talk to. Someone who’s not going to be opposed to me.</p>
