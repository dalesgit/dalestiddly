<p>We switched to Facetime © and it was so good for me to see him. Like no other call I’ve made. I suppose I would feel that way about Mary Pat. We talked music. He was vibrant and we were both searching our memories, back to the 70’s and 80’s. Mary Pat left to pick up Sean and I was able to articulate some of the struggle I feel.</p>
<p>It was good to describe the tension and challenge, but know that I was still loving Mary Pat and didn’t at all feel or want a break. He seemed like he understood. I guess that was the big thing.</p>
