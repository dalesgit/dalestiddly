<h1 id="sleeplessness">Sleeplessness</h1>
<p>Sat Oct 17, 2020 04:21 AM</p>
<p>I’m up in the wee hours again. I have been going to sleep a little earlier the last few nights because I have done so before Mary Pat. But not this much.</p>
<p>When my dreams are so filled with Hawai’i diocese stuff, it just gets more and more wound up as time goes on. I know there’s no return to sleep.</p>
<p>Tonight there was the familiar Eucharist where I was presiding, but there was one issue after another, it had to with corralling others, but when Bp. Chang saw how late I was, he became angry. Somehow I was acting on his behalf. The last I checked I was set to begin ca. 45 min. late. It had some to do with Covid19.</p>
<p>There were various faces on my heart: Kumu K? from Epiphany, now returned and riding high; there was a mention of the New York state priest who did so well at St. Mark’s. When he imposed <strong>rules</strong> on me at the Centennial, rather than doing the o’hana thing, I knew that things were changing in Hawai’i. It’s strange that +Bob thinks that it is returning to “indigenous” leadership – David G. too. As much as anything I see LA style high-power stuff as much as anything.</p>
<p>But the point of it all, really, is that I’m out of it. I made a decision not to be a part of the virtual convention because I had a sense that it would be too painful for me. Similar to my dream last night.</p>
<p>My “place in the world”. I don’t have a place in the old world any more. Who I was doesn’t count any more. That’s at least a part of what’s emerged from 2 sessions with Linda in Charlotte.</p>
<p>Viz. a viz. MP, she seems to want, after 48 hours, for things to go back to normal. She has said, “I love you”, several times, however cautiously, looking to see how I respond. I respond hesitantly. Not that I don’t love, but things seem different now. I’m a “fucking liar”.</p>
<p>It was better to just not interact with Sean yesterday. That’s why the going into the bedroom before he got home at ca. 9:30pm. I left a note with my directions in the cabinet with plastic containers. Trying to meet my boundary concerns without creating confrontation.</p>
<p>I made some headway with the recovery of the deleted partition on the old computer. I still can’t see any files, but “gparted” thinks the data is there. It took all day. Solving puzzles. And what does it mean? MP thinks I’m just distracted and spending time “on the computer”.</p>
<p>Her decision about not speaking means we don’t talk about important stuff. Similar to the dynamic at David St. in Ohio. “We love each other. That’s who we are.” I don’t put much stock in it because it ignores the serious hurt done. I haven’t responded to Shirley’s birthday greeting. Is that my resentment? I guess it is. I guess to find a clear path to a “peaceful end” I need to seek out a relief from those things.</p>
<p>Siddhartha on the river. Hurts abound. Loss is great indeed. Silent. But there is clearly peace, shalom.</p>
<p>The story about the destruction of western civilization <a href=":/fdb9475cb83247fbb8bb744da8b49c77">This is my message to the western world – your civilisation is killing life on Earth | Nemonte Nenquimo</a> in Joplin reads like a metaphor for much of what I have written today above.</p>
