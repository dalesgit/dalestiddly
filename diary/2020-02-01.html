<p>I feel so exhausted facing the next few days. I've tried to be prepared but I'm just exhausted. Like the visit with Bill. Being with him was uniformly a wonderful time, with Karla it was insightful to see the ways she has declined. But I feel exhausted from it.</p>
<p>Today: vestry retreat, finish the sermon, attend the symphony, pack for hotel.</p>
<p>Tomorrow: preach 2x's, prepare exam, review sheet, presentation, group activity.</p>
<p>Monday: class, arrange with Peter for the exam, grade discussions</p>

<p>Yesterday's vote leaves me feeling empty, utterly a stranger in a strange land. The main that keeps me taking a step at all is the repeated observation from Morris that Black Americans have lived in this reality for centuries.</p>
<p>I am a slave today.</p>
