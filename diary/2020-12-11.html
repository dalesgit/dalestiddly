<p>I woke with the thought that I haven’t fought back nearly enough. I kind of think that this is about right in response to her. “Pardon me for intruding on your fantasies.”</p>
<p>I wake in the morning with further thoughts. “Pardon me for intruding on your fantasies. I recognize that I have no control over your preference for darkness over light. I feel compassion and understanding, pity even, towards you. In fact, I feel a great many things toward you, most of which you don’t have a clue about. I admire a great many things you have accomplished in your life, but”respecting&quot; your preference for lies over truth? Your response to my words is a perfect example of why “respect” is not an appropriate response for me to make. You have relinquished the right to ‘request’ anything of me.&quot;</p>

<p>She plied me with martinis and sweet talk. But the whole plan seemed to be to talk to me about Sean and his car plans. She had checked out with Christina that she would cover for me if I didn’t want to do the help she needed to get Sean his car. She didn’t trust me. She manipulated me.</p>
<p>In the light of Emma’s rejection, nothing Mary Pat or Sean want to feed me matters really.</p>
<p>I feel completely used. The last to know. Manipulated.</p>
