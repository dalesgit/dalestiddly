<h1 id="writing-and-reflection-writing-and-reflection">Writing and Reflection {#Writing and Reflection}</h1>
<p>That came to me in the night as a summary of the things that make me tic. I acknowledged with MP yesterday that I have not been happy -- but emphasized that it wasn't her. She accepted that. She did ask me, during the news where there was a story about the rate of suicide among the nation's farmer, if I had thought about suicide. She noted that she didn't tell anyone about her thoughts when she had been suicidal. I thought about the question and answered that, &quot;No, I had not.&quot;</p>
<p>Reading []{#Absolute Truths}<strong>Absolute Truths</strong> has led me into a greater &quot;reading and reflection&quot; place and that is related to the &quot;writing and reflection&quot; that I note above. I know that a big part of the depression has to do with the question of teaching in the fall. The need to get my office out of Kinard Hall. Bringing that part of my life to a close, knowing that I can't go back, whether I teach RELG 101 or not.</p>
<p>I think I need to get out of the office for the correct perspective on deciding whether to teach. I am quite certain that MP doesn't really want me to do it.</p>
<h1 id="Decision-making">Decision-making</h1>
<p>We had relatively minor head to head yesterday that seems indicative of a basic relationship in the household that I need to pay attention to. It was over whether to install a []{#security door}<strong>security door</strong> on the front door. It would apply to: where and when we move from Rock Hill, whether I teach in the spring, ... and then little things like whether we watch TV at night, whether I pull myself away for a few hours to write or work on the computer.</p>
<p>My stance with the door was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please speak your view of things, because I have mentioned it several times and you haven't said anything. She went on to give a series of reasons for why she is not in favor it. They involve her feeling cold when I feel hot. She wanted to make a <span id="bargain"></span><strong>bargain</strong> about the door. &quot;If ... then ...&quot;</li>
<li>What I was looking for was simply an agreement that, yes, this is a good idea. I told her it seemed like a no-brainer to me.</li>
<li>The prevalance of &quot;we ought to ...&quot; and &quot;you should ...&quot; and &quot;we need to ...&quot; is really getting me down.</li>
</ul>
