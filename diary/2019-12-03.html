<p>Late yesterday I asked MP if she would like to go to Dayton the week after next since it looks like I won't be required to be at St. Paul's. (Still to be confirmed with Susan.) MP was surprised, kind of softened, and said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She's still not sure because, I think, of so much she doesn't know about what to expect from her family end. I felt disappointed because it felt like even though she has said repeatedly that &quot;she could just go alone&quot; it seems like she doesn't really mean that. Is it support I can give? Is it a dependence on me that leaves her unable to act? I don't know.</p>
<p>Late I learned that Jim will probably not have surgery until after the 15th but that Susan Norwood is uncertain whether they will want me for the 15th. I don't understand MP lack of investment in my response to St. Paul's. I guess her neediness is too great.</p>
