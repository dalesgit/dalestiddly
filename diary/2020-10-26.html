<h1 id="dreaming-of-amy-coney-barret">Dreaming of Amy Coney Barret</h1>
<p>Like all night. I peed often. Every time it was one thing or another about her. Owen asked if we knew her. His politics and hers dovetail nicely I suppose. I kept trying to calculate her birth and it always seemed wrong. She was born, I guess, during our second time in South Bend. She’s younger than Miriam.</p>
<p>I think of her as the harbinger of the end of life as we know it in the US. Such a sweet thang and I expect her to be ruthless in tearing down the country I have known.</p>
<p>I rehearsed Mary Pat’s response to me when I said that I really wish that we could go “home” to Canada. She said, “But they don’t want us.” At first it seemed like her usual writing me off. But I realized she might have been responding to the Covid situation. I was trying to tell her that I really don’t know if I can keep living in the US. She doesn’t hear it. The occasion for the thoughts was a news show about a US and Canadian citizen who got married. Because of Covid a wedding with both families was out of the question. The ceremony was on a wharf in Canada (St. Croix?) and the US family (Grandma and Grandpa) attended in a boat parked right alongside the wharf. Cute.</p>
