<p>I am surprised at how I identify with the life-style portrayed. I remember from when I read it. It feels like me in the 70’s and 80’s. I thought about how much life-change Owen dealt with in his first 9 years of life – up to 1980 or so.</p>
<p>Then came his settled life in Colorado Springs and what he thought was my settled life with Bridget. He mis-placed a stable mother onto MB. I lost him during those years.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the movie, Jeannette is fed up her dad and tells him that she wants him out of her life, not to ever contact her. Just like Emma.</p>
<p>But I was never anything like her dad in the book/movie. Oh, what to make of it?</p>
