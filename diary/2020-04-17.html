<p>When I washed the car yesterday, I was aware -- no I was consumed for 10 minutes or so -- with the intense dislike I had for Bob Fitzpatrick. He who was a friend -- think Roland Allen task force -- he who brought me to Hawai'i -- he seems to me a malignant force. He requires sycophants and needs to be idolized. He acts so grandiose and seems so petty. But all in all I figure that my emotions all have to do with Bridget and the girls. In my imagination somehow -- like a dream -- I was talking to him after all the church stuff was done -- perhaps it was in death -- and I kept calling him Mr.Â Fitzpatrick. It irritated him so I persisted.</p>
<p>Then in dreams that spanned different times in the night, last night I dreamed repeatedly of Frank Gray. It was a church event, and like many such dreams, I forgot something, or was late, or didn't understand what was expected of me. Sort of my sense of my career in the church. But there was a cathedral service where I apparently was supposed to sponsor Olga-Maria. I forgot, didn't know, missed it. And doing the whole liturgy was Frank Gray. I recognized an intense dislike for him. I'm certain it was mostly having to do with Bridget and the proximity of Lydia. Frank and Bob are two people who are still in my life, if only through Bridget and the girls.</p>
