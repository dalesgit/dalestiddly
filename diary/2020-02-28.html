<h1 id="bridget-and-dreaming-bridget-and-dreaming">Bridget and dreaming {#Bridget and dreaming}</h1>
<p>Last night as I was turning out the light I thought that I needed to make my donation to River's school &quot;Read-a-thon&quot;. I thought that maybe there was a deadline. In clicking the links to the site I discovered that Bridget had given $50 yesterday. It was a kick to the gut. I thought that Mary Pat is right. Miriam has proceeded by embracing &quot;everybody&quot; which includes one of the most evil people I've ever known and the person behind my estrangement from 2 of my children.</p>
<p>I ended up sleeping well on this last night before Mary Pat returns. There was a sense of well-being, even with all the un-finished business. As I had turned out the lights last night I thought that I am so <span id="tempted"></span><strong>tempted</strong> to hate Bridget and to be angry with Miriam. Somehow without changing my emotions or the circumstances I did pretty good at []{#letting it go}<strong>letting it go</strong>. It was like the lesson of the []{#lectio divina}<strong>lectio divina</strong> that at the temptation, the Spirit led and was present throughout Jesus' encounters with tempters. It was like the meal at the tavern last night where service was horrendous. The manager paid for my beer but I wasn't angry. I was being genuine when I said to him that I was <span id="fine"></span><strong>fine</strong>.</p>
