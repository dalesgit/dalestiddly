<p>= Examen (yesterday)=</p>
<ul>
<li>What surprised me today? The blanks in the first two reflects the weariness I feel about yesterday.</li>
<li>What inspired me today?</li>
<li>What touched me today? Ed at the hospital.</li>
<li>What did I enjoy doing today? Getting labels on all my usb drives.</li>
<li>What would I like to more of?</li>
<li>What would I like to do less of? Having to think about the atrocious theology that Olga-Maria reflected in the Eucharist.</li>
<li>What did I learn today? How expensive a new garage door will be.</li>
<li>What will I do differently tomorrow? Not as much &quot;having to be somewhere&quot;</li>
</ul>
