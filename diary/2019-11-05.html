<p>Yesterday I closed the phone call with Mary Pat with a plea that although my stuff is nowhere near what hers is, that nevertheless I had stuff going on in my life. I had in mind the sense of fatigue in not being able to just let go upon coming home, but continuing the almost 24/7 attention with Julian. Being conflicted by that because I count the time with him as among the most precious moments of my life. And that it seems that she discounts the impracticality of turning around within days to drive back to Dayton, only for the purpose of meeting with the Union Co.Â people. Feeling guilty.</p>
<p>I shouldn't express concern for my needs or convenience. Don't should on me.</p>
