<p>We bought like 11,000 points in Diamond yesterday with the written commitment that we were now to be regarded as Platinum members. MP seems like she's going to second guess and regret for a while but she's not inclined to cancel the transaction -- I asked about it this morning and last night she acknowledged that Florida law requires some kind of grace period. I was surprised that she wanted to go to the session. Then I was very surprised that she was clearly interested in the proposition that the guy (Ramon -- &quot;Ray&quot;) was offering. She asked me, &quot;Should we?&quot; But it sounded like all the other times when what that really means is, &quot;I think we should ... Do you agree?&quot; I told her I supported her in any case. When she continued I said that it seemed to me that there was good reason to be doing the sale, namely, that by using points to pay for maintenance, after 5 years we will have recovered our costs and it will be possible beginning Jan.Â 1, 2021 to pay with points instead of $. We also have written ability to share with children and for them to maintain the Platinum category.</p>
<p>Scheduled to talk with Dabney later today. Liz has had to bail because of a sinus and other kind of infection. With Dabney:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Talk about me since 1990's. Joy and freedom of being retired. Demand where I am is great.</li>
<li>What's his diocese like? State of the church? Seemed like a healthy place from the one visit we've had.</li>
<li>situation with supply clergy? Procedure?</li>
</ol>
