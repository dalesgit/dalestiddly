<ul>
<li>readied the test for posting on Sunday. MP persuaded me that fill-in the blank was problematic. That matching was more dependable. I don't like it because there seems to be very little actual learning going on. But c'est la view. She also recommended that the pedagogical guideline is that one should have no more than 10 matching; so I had to divide the vocabulary into 2 parts.</li>
<li>Finished editing the sermon for Sunday and put together a service guide for Blessing of Palms.</li>
<li>moved button and ripped seam on cassock to make it somewhat more comfortable.</li>
<li>MP filled out the census form</li>
<li>she talked to Diamond. We have an extra 3 months to take the vacations.</li>
</ul>
