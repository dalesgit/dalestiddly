<p>We had some tension yesterday. I am thinking more and more that it might be the result of spending so much time together. From my perspective it seems like MP stops listening somehow. She tends to cut me off before entirely saying whatever I start out. At times she ups the ante and answers before I speak.</p>
<p>But she was so flat out generous and gracious in observing me baking her Boston Cream Pie. She knew immediately what I was doing and why. She said several times that she appreciated the fact that I know what she likes.</p>

<p>I bought <em>God: a human history</em> by Reza Aslan. He is from Iran, a former Musliam, became evangelical when came to this country, and later returning to Islam, mostly Sufi. He wrote <em>Zealot</em> about Jesus in 2013. Interesting confluence of competing forces of today's world. NY Times panned this book, but it might be appropriate for 101 students.</p>
