<p>Yesterday the trolley and soaking in St.Â Augustine. For me the best was the Castillo, built in the 1600's. But there was a sense of weird combination of historical roots combined with a tacky tourist pitch. Henry Flagler, partner of John D. Rockefeller, built the foundations of the tourist pitch with a series of grand hotels as he built up this destination as an anchor for his train that rain down to the Miami area and then the keys.</p>
<p>I was so glad when Julian borrowed the bike and went on what would be a long ride (but for him a short one) to the []{#Dollar Tree}<strong>Dollar Tree</strong> and the post office. Miriam communicated her new address. The memories continue to flow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manitou incline, it shut down shortly after Julian et al moved there</li>
<li>Fondue restaurants, the Episcopal church, and Mo's jewelry store there in Manitou</li>
<li>Where did the &quot;springs&quot; come from in the names. CS was down somewhere in Palmer park I think he said</li>
<li>Hot springs in the mountains, he has frequented the one at President's something or other</li>
<li>When was his first plane ride? When did the security tighten up so that people couldn't come down to the gate?</li>
<li>He remembered Grandma picking them up to bring them to Rensselaer. That was maybe Christmas time and Paul picked them up for the return to Colorado, having visited his family in Ohio</li>
<li>it turns out that one of the things that was an irritant for the kids was that the 2 months that I had demanded the courts to have them for the summer had inevitably eaten into the opening of school for them (or the opening of football season).</li>
<li>Mo has had at least 1 more transient cerebral issue (while riding the horse). Julian is frightened of her involvement with the horses.</li>
</ul>
