<h1 id="homeward-bound">Homeward bound?</h1>
<p>What an amazing dream to wake up to, given the present circumstances. Mary Pat and I were with a group somewhere in Wisconsin. I’m not sure what we were doing but it was something like coming home for the holidays. There were some folks that we sort of knew like parishioners from Our Saviour. We were talking. And at some point I said to the woman that when I started my ministry I was rector of a cardinal parish at (such and such). It was an amalgam of Trinity, Wauwatosa and St. Andrew’s in Michigan City. I said that if I had followed a certain trajectory from there I would have been a bishop for 20 years by now. I said, “I’m really happy with where I am now.” And Mary Pat concurred.</p>
<p>Where I had got to was that we were in a huge garden area. There was a group of Hispanics who were harvesting, sort of a combination of lettuce and little papaya trees? There were Anglos who I guess I was associated with who had done the same thing on our plot of land. The harvesting was what? I guess there was a huge disparity between the Hispanics and our group. But we were getting our hands dirty in the same plot of ground.</p>

<p>MP gave me the link to interview with him by Anderson Cooper. It’s difficult to hear him precisely, but his spirit and general sense comes through and it’s quite moving.</p>
<ul>
<li>“I don’t have to be smart to find people who are smarter than I am.” Talking about how he gathered people around him for his foundation.</li>
<li>Father in law who gave him the ultimate notion about optimism: “No matter what’s going on, it’s getting better. The last thing you run out of is the future.” It occurred when he was feeling low, having just told his bride of 1 year that he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. “Don’t worry about it, kiddo, it only gets better.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Africatown, the only town in America founded by African Americans.</p>
<p>“Find a way when there is no way.” The founders were on Clotilda, a ship smuggling Africans into Mobile, Alabama. Ship discovered in 2018.</p>
