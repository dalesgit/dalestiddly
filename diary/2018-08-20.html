<p>Familiar pattern but new details. I was in a drama class. The teacher was familiar to me and helpful and understanding. Sort of like Gary? Or Mary Pat's Tom Polaski? We had been given a book of scripts a day or two before with our assignments. I had briefly looked at mine but not rehearsed it. I had a 1 person play.</p>
<p>We showed up for class and we were effectively doing a performance. I was last, but in the meantime, people were streaming into the classroom. They were friends of ours, peers, members of the wider community, intending to be an audience. Somehow a notice had gone out and there was a huge response.</p>
<p>It came to my turn and I was frantically just trying to find the pages. I couldn't make it work. The teacher came over to help.</p>
<p>I knew that I could do a commendable job if I could just get the text in front of me.</p>
<p>I woke.</p>
