<h1 id="valentines-day-valentines-day">Valentine's Day {#Valentineâ€™s Day}</h1>
<p>I've never thought of myself as a morning person. Easier it has normally seemed to stay up into the midnight senses. Today I realize, with a freshness not associated with being almost 70, That the best memories of my life have been around the time of dawn. Fresh mountain trout with the Jansen's Shades of Jesus on the beach Perched on The Garden of the Gods with a spiritual friend Rolling towards Loveland Ski Basin with the parking crew The arrival of my children Flying over the ocean</p>
<p>Then today I realize that you have been the occasion for more dawns than any other person I've known. It started with our eyes focused on the Pacific Ocean. Then you became companion and best friend, finding each day in the new light. Laughing at the complaint of having to watch the sun come up over the ocean for eight days in a row! You are the Valentine who begins and ends all my days. Thank you my dear.</p>
