<p>Mom is going to die in the next days or at most weeks. What do I want to record for my feelings here?</p>
<p>Is it sadness? We've just watched <em>Revolutionary Road</em> with Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslett, Kathy Bates et. al.Â It was a rendition of the ennui that kills quintessentially presented in the 1950's. I saw my mother writ all over the film. She wanted adventure. She wanted to do the crazy thing. She tried the crazy sexual adventures. But she settled. Didn't she settle?</p>
<p>And the adopted first child that none of us knew about. Wasn't that part of it? Of course. But now it's over. And what do I feel.</p>
<p>I feel tired. I'm 67 and outlived my father. I have a bunch of children from whom I am estranged. I have a woman who married me for love and loves me still. We pray together daily. I have been struggling to find a voice in my sermons and some people have resonated with them.</p>
<p>I gave the young couple who want to get married a copy of my blogs, urging them to read the Anglican presentation. Peter and Kristina want to come to Our Savior this coming Sunday because I'm going to be celebrating. I don't know how to live up to the expectations.</p>
<p>And yet, I think I need to go on, &quot;right now, to celebrate another day. I'll go on.&quot;</p>
