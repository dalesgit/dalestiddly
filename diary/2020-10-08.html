<h1 id="the-last-piece">The last piece</h1>
<p>The first thing I meet in the kitchen upon waking up, maneuvering to make the coffee for Mary Pat, is the pie pan in the sink. Thrown in the sink as a catch all. Sean ate the last piece of the French Silk Pie. Some time after we went to bed, on his own time, not with us.</p>
<p>And the focus of my bitterness toward is focused on that piece of pie. I see it as arrogance. Take whatever you can get away with. Sugar, sugar. No respect. Act like a 10 year old.</p>
<p>The fact that Mary Pat felt like she had to work so hard. The fact that I had told her several times that it was the best French Silk Pie – last night I told her it was the best since my mother.</p>
<p>I know it’s narrow-minded of me. But I feel it deep in my craw. The cost of him being here is so great. He doesn’t know. #discernment # Charlotte 10/8/20</p>

<p>She suggested that discernment is in order. She asked me for in one word what is at stake in the present time. What I came up with was my place in the world.</p>
<p>I described the way in which Sean and Mary Pat don’t appreciate my perspective on codependency and addiction. She felt the emotion rise when I described how Sean has no idea what the true cost is that’s being provided for him. And that we are enabling his dependency.</p>
<p>Linda recommends discernment, along the lines of Ignatian. Three approaches to discernment; rational, emotional, bodily. Dick helped me through emotional and bodily discernment. Linda recommended rational. perhaps the side of me I haven’t used enough lately. She suggested benefits and costs of for example doing nothing or doing something to establish boundaries?</p>
<p>She articulated the stress response of a number four as being an unhealthy caregiver. What that looks like is being resentful or distant.</p>
<p>When asked what I want in the moment I described the vision about my ashes to be spread in Hawaii, my children present, and the beach alongside Diamondhead where Mary Pat and I were to be married. For her my place in the world was a suitable phrase for that.</p>
<p>possibly the most important thing she said was that the cost of resentment is very high in a relationship like a marriage.</p>
