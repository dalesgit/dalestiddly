<p>Please consider this graphic of the module. I tried this sort of thing a few years ago and returned to it this past week. Goal is to try to bring a new perspective and perhaps greater awareness of the way each module is working.</p>
<p>The election is still far from concluded. Mary Pat reported that in 2000 it was not until Dec. that it was decided (ala the Supreme Court). The anxiety is palpable. Nothing I can do about it, so why? Is it the threat of deciding to leave the country?</p>

<p>Evidently Emma got married last week. The occasion for Lydia’s trip to Portland. I’ve just downloaded the photos posted on her Facebook page, my only source of the news. Miriam and kids were there. She didn’t tell me. Lydia didn’t. Presumeably Bridget was there. David? Did Bill know? No one thought it was appropriate for me to know.</p>
<p>I am boggled to understand how anyone could think that’s appropriate. But it leaves me feeling kinship with apocalyptic, at least eschatological, ideation.</p>
