<p>First there was the wife of the junior warden. Tears streaming down on, was it Palm Sunday? I went and tried to give her words that bring God to bear.</p>
<p>Then Mary Pat reported the mother of the 2 teen age girls. She wept uncontrollably after my Vigil sermon. She said to Mary Pat that she often heard voices that said bad things. And that while I was preaching I cast out the voices. The next day she gave almost a mantra: &quot;Extravagance and Abundance.&quot;</p>
<p>Jo S. said that my time with them had made the frozen church a little less frozen.</p>
<p>Henry said, &quot;I'm going to miss you.&quot; Every sermon you give me something to think about.</p>
<p>There were many others. And then I felt a little bit hurt that I learned that the new priest would be there on July 8 at the same time the rest of the congregation learned that detail. Still none of us knows the name of this person. We know he's a he.</p>

<p>The meal was breathtaking. antipasto plate. rare steaks with shrimp scampi with scallops. a sort of German potato salad. beans that were steamed then sauteed in various things. cheese plater. some kind of cheese frittata sort of thing with Gran Marnier sprinkled on top.</p>
<p>But most amazing was that we seemed to go deep pretty easily. Christina spoke of words Peter's brother had said to their daughter -- words that still burn. And she asked, &quot;How to forgive.&quot; I tried to bring God's touch into place.</p>
