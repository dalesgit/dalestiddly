<p>Desperately terrible alienation between MP and me overnight and it was for no good reason. Mostly my fault. She has trouble not being defensive. It really was no big deal for me.</p>
<p>A similarity with Bridget that is difficult for me. MP says I've &quot;yelled&quot; at her even if I speak in a gentle whisper but behind the whisper is an irritation, a disapproval, a frustration, even an exasperation. Then defensiveness escalates things.</p>
<p>We go home today. A good thing I guess. But I was so glad for Beth and MP going to breakfast yesterday. All of it marred by the news about the car wreck and deaths involving friends of Katie's.</p>

<p>I dreamed about the application &quot;Checkvist&quot; this morning. Over and over and the message seemed to be that it was a near &quot;perfect&quot; application for me. Weird.</p>
