<p>I had the doctor's checkup and he gave suggestions for choosing readers. I am to go with the lowest magnification I can get away with, because the higher magnification causes more strain on the eye.</p>

<li>having to do with the peripheral vision -- cf.Â seeing things on the wall at the tavern today</li>
<li>seeing colors with precision that were marred, perhaps especially by the graduated lenses</li>
