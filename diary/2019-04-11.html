<li>Underwood: Your paper is very good as it stands. It begins a little abruptly, so a sentence or two of introduction would have helped. It seemed the 2nd half of the essay had more grammatical and word choice problems. You should explain the use of term &quot;prophetic&quot; a bit more. But none of them were major problems. I have marked places that need work. Good job.</li>
