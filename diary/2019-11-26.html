<h1 id="Irony">Irony</h1>
<p>I told MP at some point today, &quot;Actually, practically everything I say is at least tinged with irony.&quot;</p>
<p>That was an important statement for me to process. I think it in fact is largely true.</p>
<p>It came in the context of MP and I talking a little bit after she expressed alarm at my anger expressed at Dale Westerbrook intruding in our tree work -- after all the preparatory work I invested and in effect calling a halt to work on &quot;his trees.&quot; What I had to say about that is that I wish there was clarity about who owned the trees. I then had stomped away proclaiming that the work was not something for the HOA but was simply <span id="maintenance"></span><strong>maintenance</strong>.</p>
<p>Both of us expressed the obvious truth that we are both under a lot of pressure. The unspoken recommendation I would give to a couple coming to me is to have patience and flexibility with your partner.</p>
<p>No irony with that recommendation.</p>
