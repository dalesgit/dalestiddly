<p>Dreaming was somehow restful and satisfying this morning. Content I just don't remember. But last night before going to bed we watched <em>Don't Look Back</em> a movie filmed on Bob Dylan's 1965 tour in England and introduced in 1967.</p>
<p>There was nostalgia. Reliving some old memories of being a 15 year old. Folk music. Don DeBacker. Denver folklore center. Playing jug at a bar in the mountains.</p>
<hr />
<p>Today is the anniversary of Captain Cook's arrival in Hawai'i. Oh my!</p>

<p>Yet another squabble and this one again over such a trifle. But it had to do with finances, so in that regard it is classic.</p>
