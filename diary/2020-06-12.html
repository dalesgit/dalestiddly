<p>This is an entry made on the Macbook Air. We drove to Monroe. There we were surprised to learn that MP wasn't reading -- she was just present. But she was just present so that they could give us a thank you and fruit basket. Fr. Jim was present so we got to chat with him.</p>
<p>He seems so weak. Today we have found much confirmation of our determination to wear masks during pandemic.</p>
<p>In conversation tonight with Bill, he in a sort of backwards way informed me that Emma was engaged to her &quot;Russian&quot; -- Nicholas, or something. Bill was saying it in the context of the article in NYTimes about epidemiologists and what they are willing to do in upcoming months and years. If they are to be married this summer, Bill &amp; Karla won't be attending.</p>
<p>Never mind the irony and bitterness of the fact that her father hasn't been informed and won't be invited.</p>
