<p>Mary Pat’s lab work came back. Her mole was a “moderate” melanoma that they need to monitor in 3 months.</p>
<p>I’m scared and intimidated by it. She didn’t want my comfort.</p>
<p>She had returned from her first counseling session. She seemed relieved by the fact that the social worker (I think) counselors took Medicare and so we could go as a couple.</p>
<p>I got the appointment to pursue a spiritual director in Charlotte. No insurance there. # Dream of the student who can’t do papers</p>
<p>Once again the last dream of the night was the familiar one. I was taking (I think graduate classes) and I was seemingly habitually unable to do the work. I was one of those students who seemingly have no intention of doing the work, though my thought process in the dream is something like, “I will do this” or “I’ll get it done next time.”</p>
<p>The class I was screwing up this time had a substitute teacher. She was a woman of color. Seemed nice. I hung around til after the exam was turned in – I didn’t take it – and I wanted to tell her of my plans to do better, or turn it in late. She met a colleague and said something disparaging about me. Didn’t speak directly to me.</p>
<p>I ran away, humiliated. I tried to make my way up the large building. A student center, dormitory, cafeteria. I have always identified it with Notre Dame buildings, though I never actually lived in a dorm there. It was as if my room there was a temporary room, but I couldn’t find my way. I couldn’t follow the stairways and elevators up to my room. The nearest building that seemed like it in my experience was the library.</p>
<p>Then Mary Pat woke me.</p>
<h1 id="enneagram">Enneagram</h1>
<p>The person I am meeting with was interested in my connection to <em>Enneagram</em>. I couldn’t remember so I’ve had to refresh myself a litte. I have 3 personalities that are very high. But I think the one that is highest is the Investigator. Perhaps that’s why I had the dream I did.</p>
<p>I was and am a student. But I never finished. And most of my career the teaching part was secondary. But I was a kind of student-priest – never quite fitting in there. That’s the “Peacemaker”</p>
<p>The blend of roles might be associated with “INFP” and “INFJ”.</p>

<p>She first encountered through Bp. Remy &amp; his partner at a workshop. They added biblical figures or saints to each of the 9 points of the star.</p>
<p>She reports being a 2 with ??</p>
<p>cf. from web:</p>
<p>Enneagram Type 2 (The Giver) Since your sense of well-being is tied to the relationships you have with others, any type of conflict or people giving you the cold shoulder is going to leave you feeling lost in the dust.</p>
<p>Under stress, you disintegrate to Type 8 (The Challenger) and may get pushy in the pursuit of securing love and affection. You become tyrannical and controlling, to the point where everyone in your circle may feel like they’re walking on eggshells. Under dire circumstances, you may corner people into making harsh decisions about your relationships.</p>
<p>How you can beat stress:</p>
<p>Try art or music therapy. Better yet, explore your (perhaps dormant) artistic side and let your feelings unleash themselves.</p>
<p>Read into self-discovery and learn more about your personal identity.</p>
<p>Go on a shopping spree or two to develop your own unique style.</p>
<p>Let others know you’re taking time off to heal and grow on your own for a while.</p>
<p>Take time exploring your cultural background by chatting with relatives all over your family tree.</p>
<h1 id="my-stress-situation">My stress situation</h1>
<p>Enneagram Type 5 (The Investigator) Your stress alarm sounds when your personal space and privacy has been invaded one too many times. At this point, you may lapse into angry fits, tearful meltdowns and a general lack of concentration. And while you’re at it, you hit the “isolate” button faster than you can tell others to leave you alone.</p>
<p>Under stress, you disintegrate to Type 7 (The Enthusiast) and partake in wild and outlandish activities to shut down your brain’s “thinking” side and rev up the “feel-good” pleasure centers. You begin to “live for the moment” and chase the next “high”. And yes, it’s a slippery slope toward a bucketload of intense addictions.</p>
<p>How you can beat stress:</p>
<p>Make a conscious effort to reconnect with people and nature.</p>
<p>Read books and watch videos on emotional intelligence and apply them in your interactions with others.</p>
<p>Participate in groups such as Toastmasters or improvisation in your local area.</p>
<p>Incorporate healthier foods into your diet and make exercise a part of your daily routine.</p>
<p>Dare to try activities outside of your comfort zone—good news: it gets easier each time.</p>

<p>She thinks that there is no real difference between Biden and Trump. To us it seems utterly bizarre. My intuition is telling that she is precisely why the country is going to go down. But how do I put it into words?</p>
<p>I’m not going to tell Mary Pat because it would only go down badly with her family.</p>
<p>But I think, if someone can not tell the difference between a man who is clearly honorable, desiring to serve others, a religious man trying to be a public servant – vs. – a man who is clearly evil, mentally malicious, and has conducted himself for 3+ years as a man above the law, intent only on serving himself and his cronies, not caring one twit for the country or our heritage – a man who mocks handicapped people – then that person can not discern right from wrong, disaster from hope, catastrophe from new creation. That person is beyond reasoning clearly, but that person is an instrument of Armageddon for the country and perhaps the world.</p>
<p>We saw lots of people like that in Germany in the 30’s and 40’s, Nigeria in the 60’s, Cambodia in the 70’s, Rwanda in the 90’s, Russia, China, Sudan, … the story goes on and on. It is facilitated by people who looked the other way, who had a blind eye to what was right before them, who refused to act on basic humanity, certainly the gospel, and stumbled into horror.</p>
<p>Well, here we go.</p>
<p>Yes, there was a rupture with the family last year. But it was inevitable, probably, because they were mostly Trump supporters and still are quietly, as if by default.</p>
