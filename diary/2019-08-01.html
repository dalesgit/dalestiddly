<p>David had called Sue before she went down on Tuesday noon service, asking her to preach on (last) Sunday's gospel (Lord's Prayer etc.) She agreed and was totally <span id="inspired"></span><strong>inspired</strong> Monday to teach on &quot;Our Father&quot;.</p>
<p>Present was the associate pastor of a baptist church that feels a sense of responsibility to support St. Mark's (or David).</p>
<p>Sue was deeply distraught. I think because she saw a deep power play by David, wanting to be a preacher. She had been expecting the meal especially to have been pitched to homeless. She saw no one who was homeless, but hangers on, people looking for a meal, people from other churches.</p>
<p>I suggested that she share with Janey but she is reluctant at the moment.</p>
<p>Mary Pat has the same kind of <span id="dark"></span><strong>dark</strong> intuition about being at St. Mark's, saying that she doesn't feel the same being at St. Peter's which is simply a private chapel for Speedy and family at this point.</p>
<h1 id="phone-call-with-ss-admin-josh-phone-call-with-ss-admin-josh">Phone call with SS Admin (Josh) {#Phone call with SS Admin (Josh)}</h1>
<p>He was prompt with his phone call. He is throwing wrinkles at her. WEP offset is $92.40 or so -- he agrees. HE seems to say that her rollover counts as a <span id="withdrawal"></span><strong>withdrawal</strong>.</p>
<p>&quot;How would my benefits be different if I had never touched the investment?&quot;</p>
<p>Mary Pat seems satisfied with the answers he is giving her. It seems as if we're settled on amounts.</p>
<p>I gave him identifying information about me, but only the last 4 digits of SS #.</p>
<p>It appears that her SS is grossly less than we expected.</p>
<p>Key piece seems to be that WEP kicks in when <span id="distribution"></span><strong>distribution</strong> happened (in our case 2005). In our case it wasn't a <span id="distribution"></span><strong>distribution</strong> it was a <span id="rollover"></span><strong>rollover</strong>.</p>
<p>The shocking amount has to do with the spousal benefit. Because he is calling the rollover a <span id="distribution"></span><strong>distribution</strong> the amount will be $4,300 rather than something like $8,000.</p>
