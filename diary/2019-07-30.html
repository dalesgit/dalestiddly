<p>I'm not sure where we left it, yesterday. We continued with the day. Watched &quot;W&quot; the Oliver Stone biopic on George W's career. The weird part of that is that what seemed so far beyond the pale then, now seems way inside the norm now. Trump has destroyed so much of the fabric of our country.</p>
<p>Mary Pat and I bought a shredder together. She would have preferred the smallest replacement of our old one. I felt the need for some kind of upgrade. She gave her approval for 1 step up.</p>
<p>I wish I could remember my dream the middle of the night. Even at the time I thought I wished I would be able to. I would have needed to wake up and record it. Did it have to do with moving?</p>

<p>I finished reading this novel yesterday. I really want to reflect in some way on the experience, because it seemed to touch me so deeply the 2 times I read it. I read it one time before going to Hawai'i and one time after leaving Hawai'i. Today in conversation with Sue Parker (3-way call) Mary Pat made reference to &quot;being called&quot; to Hawai'i.</p>
<p>A quick scan of the things I marked:</p>
<ul>
<li>mana, passed from grandfather to grandson</li>
<li>geography and environments that sound familiar after living in Hawai'i</li>
<li>&quot;Don't kid yourself ... we're all prisoners, of our genes, of our history, of our long, ancestral dreams ...&quot;</li>
<li>the sensitivity to spiritual authority being exercised by a flawed human being</li>
<li><span id="mana"></span><strong>mana</strong> being something like the power that the Israelites knew was in the Ark of the Covenant, was with Moses when he went up on the mountain -- the people in the novel knew of this</li>
<li>the combination of Magnusson going to the place of the elders to die, and the same trip was the initiation rite that made Mark an adult, where he heard God or gods speak, &quot;the voice&quot;</li>
<li>pp 127-8, a priest (Flanagan) describes <span id="faith"></span><strong>faith</strong> as the &quot;arithmetic of the cosmos&quot; providing order in chaos</li>
<li>p 156-7 for Gunnar there was not one cosmogony but many</li>
<li>p. 167 &quot;The journey is more important than the arrival&quot;</li>
<li>p. 200 &quot;the essence of <em>kapu</em> ... the foundation of respect for established order.&quot;</li>
<li>p. 236 &quot;All the dead look alike, ... the same flowers grow over them all. Problem is, a man's last hours belong only to him. No one has the right to intrude with complaints or excuses or fears or hates.&quot;</li>
<li>the controversies, dynamics of rise and fall, of the community</li>
<li>p 288 awareness of the human compulsion to mess things up</li>
</ul>
