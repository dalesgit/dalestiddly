<ul>
<li>Part of the attraction has been</li>
<li>that I felt loved and appreciated by Mary Pat. I don’t now.</li>
<li>From the “showdown” conversation, I told her that “love” hurt so much</li>
<li>Does it matter, now, if I tell her that the elephant is “codependency”?</li>
<li>So much, now, I don’t care. She and Sean can go on about their business.</li>
<li>I do care about finding “peace” before I die.</li>
<li>I do care about letting go of “resentment”</li>
<li>That means, at least, to forgive MP for the hurts she’s given – for I have surely given my own</li>
<li>But it feels like I’m on my own, now</li>
</ul>
