<p>I am basically pleased with the way in which the classes processed that panel presentations. A significant portion were able to listen, to make connections, find patterns. I think the concept <span id="forgiveness"></span><strong>forgiveness</strong> resonated with them. Important, then, that there were so many facets about the concept.</p>
<p>I was particularly impressed in 2nd class when Jameel noticed the demand for forgiveness was especially strong among the Buddhists and that this might be explained by the fact that they operate from a presumption of <span id="karmic"></span><strong>karmic</strong> justice.</p>

<p>Shirley and Paul have been there since I think yesterday. Bill arrived today, in time for the health meeting with the care-givers. He reported that that wasn't all that great. He reports that New Mexico doesn't have the rule about keeping the house; so in order to get Mom to Medicare paying for nursing facility we have to exhaust <span id="all"></span><strong>all</strong> the assets.</p>
<p>Paul has played the wise older whatever and talked about what they did with his parents, getting a reverse mortgage, on $ 130,000 house getting about $90,00 to work with and of that they only went through about $60,000 before they were both deceased.</p>
<p>Bill reports that Shirley doesn't engage very well, with Mom or really with anybody. I can picture Paul being the care-giver to Shirley's personality disorder whatever it is. He would be the one to think that they ought to go see &quot;Helen&quot;. He is the one who tries to engage Mom with the crossword puzzles. He is the one who made the phone call to Bill, while Shirley stayed in the background making comments on the proceedings.</p>
<p>I asked Bill about his memory of what Shirley means by my multiple <span id="assaults"></span><strong>assaults</strong> of her. He gave as an example that he could remember that there was some kind of argument about Shirley leaving for somewhere. Mom wanted her to stay. Shirley wanted to go. As she headed down the stairs I grabbed her arm to try to stop her from going.</p>
<p>For context, Bill related an incident that he said I probably don't even remember. He's right, I don't remember it. He and I were arguing about something. It carried out into a fight on the front lawn. He got the better of me, was on top of me, and then slugged me in the face. That was an <span id="assault"></span><strong>assault</strong> but I don't even remember the incident.</p>
