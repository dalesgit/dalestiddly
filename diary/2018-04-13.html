<p>I am making some progress. So much to do. And I really relish the rest.</p>
<h2 id="miriams-call-miriams-call">Miriam's call {#Miriamâ€™s call}</h2>
<p>She sent a message she was going to call. Mary Pat really doesn't want me to cut off the relationship in the event Bridget is thought of as a grandmother. I don't know. Death, death, all around me.</p>

<li>how do your kids think of Bridget</li>
<li>Do you not think she is to blame for the alienation?</li>
<li>Where were we in talking about the saga of Shirley, Mom, and Carolyn?</li>

<li>she acknowledged having a relationship with Bridget and was non-committal about my statement that Bridget was the cause of my alienation from the girls. She said I just don't want to get involved with that -- rather just accepting people where they are.</li>
<li>I ended up saying, &quot;OK&quot; to her statement about wanting to have separate relationships with everyone in the dysfunctional family.

<li>Then I went on to say that actions have consequences</li>

<p>Mom has refused to go to physical therapy &amp; that means she may have to leave the unit she is in. They will give Bill 5 days to decide. He was floating the possibility that he is inclined to think that &quot;The Arbors&quot; is a more viable place for her to go to. Charlene is keen on it. It would be cheaper. They don't have a nursing unit, but they do have a hospice component. Glick has asked Bill about hospice and wants to sort out where she needs to go next.</p>
<p>I told him I was in favor of what makes mom more comfortable in these her last days. I told Bill / Karla about the conversation with Miriam. Karla spoke of how she figured it stemmed from early childhood stuff (presumably on the part of Shirley).</p>
