<h1 id="about-dreaming-about-dreaming">About dreaming {#About dreaming}</h1>
<p>I realized something today as I was waking up. That the thing that often pushes me to wake up is dreaming about some work/task I need to do during the day, and then dreaming about it over and over again.</p>
<p>I thought that very mundane thought as I was realizing that I had not been dreaming about Hawai'i. I had been the last few days. And in my waking time I had realized that my dreams are often set in Hawai'i.</p>
<p>Part of my reverie was prompted by several emails from +Bob. I so detest the man. Yet it is because of him that I ended up in Hawai'i. I am so appalled by the fitness of the portrait of him as a malevolent religious dictator, cf.Â John's conversations and the book he and ? shared about Michael Servitus. And yet in Bob's message to the diocese from yesterday, describing his take on the spirit of the church in Hawai'i, I am supportive of most of it. Where I differ is in a disagreement about his own view of the church as &quot;Catholic.&quot; I thought even while on the Standing Committee, and often in later months, that he doesn't know himself very well. That he poses thoughts for public consumption but doesn't recognize that is own actions belie his statements. His self-righteousness is another example.</p>
<p>Ah. So it is.</p>
