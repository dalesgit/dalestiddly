<h1 id="dream-of-walking-trying-to-get-home">Dream of walking, trying to get home</h1>
<p>I was walking and walking. At first trying to catch a bus, then I realized that I might as well just walk.</p>
<p>Trying to get away from the terminal of some kind – often in my dreams – I ended up in a building. Something like the Notre Dame building I couldn’t escape, but this was different. More like an apartment building in Honolulu. I was trying to get to a landing in the building that would let me out onto land. I ended up going all the way to the top. There was a pre-school that felt a whole lot like <strong>Angels at Play</strong>.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get out. I raced downstairs. There was someone behind me. I couldn’t believe they were keeping up. I thought it was one of the little kids. But towards the end I glanced and it was a man, obviously chasing me. But he didn’t really seem dangerous – or perhaps I just wasn’t afraid.</p>
<p>There had been a point at which I got to a place that I thought was a bus stop. But that’s when I thought, “I should just walk.” Yesterday I read about someone who, since the pandemic, has been walking 20,000 steps. It seemed like so much. But as I sit more and more with it I imagine that maybe 3 hours of walking a day would be comforting for me.</p>
<p>There are only two places where I rode the bus very often: Colorado Springs and Honolulu.</p>

<p>I have debated for days what to do when Sean came into my midst without a shirt on. Walking out. I have wondered whether that was lacking courage, passive aggressive, not being authentic. And yet I thought making a big deal about something so seemingly minimal seemed to convey something I didn’t want. Does it convey that I am insignificant? Is my desire to not rock the boat matter over everything? Or is it that what I object to his his thumbing his nose? And enforcing some rule doesn’t change that.</p>
<p>Same is true of the dish-washing issue. I don’t want to be a part of Mary Pat’s dishwashing crew that she orders around. I don’t want to have to bear with Sean’s standards of doing half-assed jobs. I don’t want to have to try to enforce military style rules that don’t achieve the goal of respect and conscientiousness.</p>
<p>Shirley’s birthday. Bill and I are agreed that we forgot her.</p>

<p>For we do not find wholeness until we are willing to enter the broken, empty places in our lives and confront them honestly. We do not find God’s presence without first wading through His absence. <em>God’s Joyful Surprise: Finding Yourself Loved</em> Kindle Edition by Sue Monk Kidd</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading this tonight I wondered what is my <strong>absence</strong> that I need to wade through? Emma’s rejection? Sean’s presence?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But to grow toward deeper places we must pay attention to our pain and its causes and be willing to let them lead us somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where’s the pain? It’s in the loss. But also in the betrayal. In the loneliness I guess of living in the midst of people who mock what I hold dear. Reading <em>God’s Joyful Surprise</em>.</p>
