<p>As we went to sleep, MP said, tomorrow can we talk. I said I've been trying to talk all day. Of course. She was surprised to hear me say that I had wanted tot talk.</p>
<p>I bought African violets and gave them to her as a kind of peace offering.</p>
<p>It is morning. She is going to meet with Christina. We watched movies. There was some peace. There is no peace inside of me with regard to her family. So much lost opportunity for redemption. And they threw it away for such petty dynamics.</p>
<p>But why my anger?</p>
<h1 id="Talking">Talking</h1>
<p>She put her telling me that Beth was glad I wasn't there in the context of what I would do. She said if Lydia or Shirley had told me that they thought MP was a &quot;whore&quot; I wouldn't have relayed that to MP. I would have wanted to protect her.</p>
<p>She acknowledges that Beth has said things she should not have said:</p>
<ul>
<li>she/they thing that MP wants mom to die</li>
<li>lying about moving into the house so that we would move out</li>
</ul>
<p>MP wanted me to be with her to support her -- giving the eg. of when I did crossword puzzle with her while meeting Libby and Dr.Â Joe.</p>
<p>She said she had thought that the days I spent long hours at the house that I was going to leave and come back.</p>
<p>Number 1 emotion: []{#She feels so alone.}<strong>She feels so alone.</strong> Cut off from her family and cut off from me.</p>
<p>I said that I wanted most of all to not get in the way of what she needs to do with family. She said, &quot;That's not enough for me.&quot;</p>
