<h1 id="who-am-i">Who am I</h1>
<p>Sun Oct 11, 2020 12:37 AM #discernment I just have no idea who I am. Is it Covid that has shaken it? Is it Sean? Is it a loss of faith. Is it a transcendence from parochial (i.e. Episcopal, make-a-living) to more universal (i.e. anticipating melding in with the universe itself, the apocalyptic visions of 2020?).</p>

<p>Linda,</p>
<p>Thank you for this. I have done a lot of journaling in the last few days. Not being able to go to sleep on one night? I guess that counts as listening to my body. I will take the pieces you share here and try to be more intentional with them. All in all, it has been hard for me to know what it is I’m focusing on. What are my options? What do I have control over? I read some samples of Louise Glück last night when I couldn’t sleep. It felt like it was giving me permission of some kind. Thank you again.</p>

As a reminder, this is what we talked about: &gt; &gt; Discernment by reason- make a 4 column list of gains and losses- what I gain and lose if I make changes (boundaries, talking about how I feel, etc) and what I gain and lose if I keep things the way they are (staying quiet to keep peace, continue to enable, etc) All of this should be considered before God asking for clarity around what affects my spirit, what is healthiest for all, what is most loving (Being in line with God’s will) &gt; The length of the lists is not what matters vs the weight of the topics) &gt; &gt; Discernment through the Body- tell yourself you are going to make changes for 2 days and see how your body responds. How do I sleep, dreams that might give me indications that this is a good choice, anything that shows up for me in terms of headache, aches, pains, appetite changes, etc. Then do the opposite for 2 days - I’m not going to make changes. Notice the same things. &gt; &gt; I will send a couple of discernment exercises that deal with imagination and feelings which you can do as a layered approach after you do the above. &gt; &gt; Also, two other things I want to remind you of re: our session. The emotion of resentment came up. I’m wondering if you would be willing to work with that via a “cinquain” poem? Often times that sort of exercise clarifies what we can not otherwise reach. Here is the formula for that &gt; -First line is one word: resentment (topic at hand) &gt; -Two adjectives the describe the topic &gt; -Three adverbs or action verbs that describe what the topic Is “doing” &gt; -a four word sentence that captures the essence Or feelings about the topic (like “eating me up inside”) &gt; -fifth line is a one word metaphor or symbol for the topic &gt; &gt; I’ll be curious as to what you discover! &gt; &gt; Lastly remember when I asked you what was at stake for you, you said “my place in the world.” &gt; That maybe something to explore as well via journaling. Get curious about that statement. Ask the “part” of you that is concerned about your place in the world questions you’d like to know about It. &gt; &gt; Lots of good inner work to do! But there is no rush. Go at your own pace. &gt; &gt; Peace be with you, &gt; Linda &gt; &gt; Linda Serepca &gt; Director, Charlotte Spirituality Ctr &gt; www.charlottespiritualitycenter.org &gt; 704-776-3787 cell</p>

<p>a “cinquain” poem?</p>
<p>Resentment<br />
<em>Silent, angry</em> bitter, critical creeping, named, repeatedly Convicts me; spurs me. Grave</p>
<p>creeping up on me, feeling named when it was mentioned, reminded of video sessions in the 1980’s at counseling center: re-sentire (feeling again)</p>
<p>I feel convicted by naming it. I wonder how many areas of my life are afflicted with it. I remember my repeatedly not wanting to be an old person who is always bitter and complaining. In contrast to the sense of ending, loss, etc. with re. retirement and growing old, perhaps I can find a way to discover anew.</p>
