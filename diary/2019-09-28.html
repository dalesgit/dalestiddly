<p>Yesterday I met for a short time with Peter about my teaching next semester. He seemed very eager to accommodate me. As I was finishing up he stopped to tell Will the decisions, since the affected him. Will said that he hoped it would be good for me. I responded that I hoped it would be good for the kids. He said, &quot;Oh, I'm sure it will be good for them.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't know what he based his statement on. I purposely don't pay attention to the online ways that students rate their professors. But it was gratifying to hear that.</p>
<p>I kept trying to listen to my emotions, even from the night before when Peter told me that he wanted to offer it to me. Before dinner on Thursday I had turned the lack of response from Peter as a reluctance to tell me that they were &quot;going in a new direction.&quot;</p>
<p>My feelings have continued to be satisfied, peaceful, a little bit afraid, but not embarrassed to tell others (like Sue at supper last night) of the decision.</p>
<p>It seems to me that all along &quot;retirement&quot; was Mary Pat's move.</p>
