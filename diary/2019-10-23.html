<p>The day spent at the Kennedy Space Center. A strange combination of Disney World and the Museum of Science and Energy. There was a sacred feel to being in the space that such monumental human steps have been taken. It also had a fantasy feel as it glorified technology and scientific/engineering feats, implying that humanity was marching from knowledge to knowledge in victory, while the truth is that humanity may not make it to the 22nd century, certainly not with a sense of marching forward in victory.</p>
<p>I am apprehensive about calling and talking to Dabney. I am apprehensive about Julian living with us for a week. Not so much the talk with Liz as if there's not that much cost or that much at stake with her.</p>
