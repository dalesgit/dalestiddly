<p>She called today, thinking that someone from the vestry had called to inform me that they had approved me to be her sponsoring priest for the ordination process at Diocese. I was embarrassed to say, &quot;No they hadn't&quot; but I would be glad to be such a person.</p>
<p>She said that the next thing I would need to do in the next few weeks is to write a letter to the diocese stating that I support her discernment process and see no impediments. We will meet next week to flesh this out.</p>
<p>Later Russ called to apologize for not calling me. He is on the congregation discernment committee. Rick Hanners (sp?) is the head of it.</p>
<p>Russ reports again how the vestry not only supports me in this process but would like to see more of me.</p>

<p>While in the shower. I thought about my greatest concern as far as []{#conduct unbecoming}<strong>conduct unbecoming</strong> goes with regard to my ministry. It goes back to the time of my first divorce. The way that I thought about it was that I didn't want to do anything that would harm the &quot;body of Christ.&quot; I suppose that's why []{#Peter Gomes’}<strong>Peter Gomes'</strong> words to me were so poignant: &quot;Lord, I pray that in my preaching I will do no harm.&quot;</p>
<p>I think frequently about how when I said to (David Gierlach) at Christmas time that I thought Bob should put up on charges of &quot;conduct unbecoming.&quot; He was freaked out by it and quickly shoed me off the property.</p>
<p>It was Lynn from Moloka'i who was the first who told me that Bob was a liar. That would have been not long after his ordination. Perhaps even before. That was with regard to a difficult situation. She clearly needed to find an exit strategy after raising her family in the localized situation there.</p>
<p>Later I saw Bob's intentional inaction at Calvary, intended to drive the congregation into the ground. It's what he knew how to do. Close a congregation in order to build something new. It's the mantra he has repeated over and over and I know of it because he spoke of it often at Standing intentional inaction at Calvary, intended to drive the congregation into the ground. It's what he knew how to do. Close a congregation in order to build something new. It's the mantra he has repeated over and over and I know of it because he spoke of it often at Standing Committee.</p>
<p>Later it was his conduct at Holy Nativity and his treatment of the rector there. I heard from where of his quoted comments of disparagement of her. I knew of his gossip like behavior from small groups with him and standing committee.</p>
<p>There was his insensitivity telling St. Mary's that he was doing a good job getting rid of his older priests -- standing in front of one of the oldest in the diocese.</p>
<p>His patent self-serving deceptions in his words about Lydia and Emma.</p>
<p>I think he has caused more people to leave the Episcopal Church than I could possibly have effected in several lifetimes.</p>

<li>Gathering data. Having them respond.</li>

<p>Feedback Comment on specific items that represent strengths and areas where improvement, growth, and/or attention should be indicated. Include a discussion of progress toward past goals and development of future goals when applicable. The Rev. Dale Hathaway has now completed his 4th academic year as an adjunct professor in our department. He has established himself as a well respected professor whom colleagues and students regard as a person of integrity. He typically teaches three courses per semester, two sections of our Introduction to Religious Studies (RELG 101) and one other, which varies. This year, he had four sections of 101 (with a coupld of attached Honors sections) and Intro to Hebrew Bible / Old Testament (RELG 313) in fall and Modern Christian Thought (RELG 317) in spring.</p>
<p>I can say from observation of his office presence, discussion with him, and review of his course syllabi and other materials that Dale pours himself whole heartedly into his teaching. This is equally reflected now in his reporting on each of his courses and his reflections on student evaluations and student learning. For each course, he gives a review of what he aims to accomplish, the changes he has made to his materials and delivery, what worked well and what not so well, and the student reactions. Dale definitely cares about his students beyond their simply succeeding in his course, but their intellectual development, and their ability to read, think, and write critically and intelligently in our field of religions, religious studies, and theology.</p>
<p>Student evaluations are indeed generally quite positive. We must work, however, to find ways to improve student response to the online course evaluation. Of all six courses Dale taught, the response rates were 68%, 67%, 61%, 52%, 41%, and 38%. this has to be better.</p>
<p>It is also of some interest that in each of these sections, there are always students who express their dissatisfaction with the clarity of Dale's expectations. They are quite clearly a minority, but this may be something to work on in the future.</p>
<p>In his summary, Dale mentions having published some of his professional writings. As an adjunct, he is not required to maintain a scholarly profile, but it would be interesting for him to list some of his work in the Scholarly Activity section of the report so that we can have an appreciation of his writing and presentations.</p>
<p>Another very good year for Dale Hathaway. We are grateful to have him teaching on a regular basis for us, especially since a number of our full-timers are serving in administrative roles and so are not teaching their usual load. Dale is an asset to the department in both skill and attitude.</p>
